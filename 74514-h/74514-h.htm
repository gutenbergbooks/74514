<p><i>Along in 1909, Fisher and I were working
for the same newspaper, Fisher as a special
writer and I in the art department. We both
subsequently escaped, but that is another story.
Just then I happened to be working on the</i>
<span class="allsmcap">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF MARK TWAIN</span> <i>(Harper,
1910). Fisher told me that he was going to
do some magazine stories on Mark and promised
to let me have proofs, but a week or two
later he went away on one of his periodical
trips to Europe, and I lost track of him for
several years.</i></p>

<p><i>Some time in 1921, I met him on Broadway,
New York. “Hello, Fisher,” says I, “where
have you been, what are you doing, and where
are those flowing whiskers you used to sport?”</i></p>

<p><i>“Hello, Johnson,” replied Fisher, peering
at me through his thick glasses, “I am just
back from London, the air raids scared off my
whiskers, and my eyesight has become so bad,
I am only fit to be a ‘dictator’ now.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Well,” says I, continuing our conversation
of many years ago, “where are those Mark
Twain yarns you promised me?”</i></p>

<p><i>“In my head,” he said; “never had time to
put them on paper.” “You know,” he added,
“old Mark and I spent many weeks and months
together in Berlin and Vienna and frequently
met in London and Paris, not to mention more
out-of-the-way places, and if I really put my
mind to it, I can remember reams of Mark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
Twain’s sayings, while others are available in
notebooks, diaries and such I kept off and on.
And come to think of it, I can tell you about
Eugene Field over there as well. I happened
to occupy an editorial position in London, while
Gene tried to set the Thames afire and—failed,
poor chap.”</i></p>

<p><i>“Then,” says I, “come up to the studio any
day, to-morrow if you like. I will have a stenographer
there and you can start dictating your
stories and we shall set the world laughing, putting
them in a book.”</i></p>

<p><i>Fisher did, and here’s the book.</i></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>Twain and Field did not expatriate themselves
to the extent of other gifted Americans—Henry
James, Bret Harte, Whistler, Abbey and
Sargent—yet Twain settled down for months,
and even years, in various European countries,
while Field tried, during a hundred days or
more, to make a go of it in London, before capitulating
to climate and home-hunger.</i></p>

<p><i>Previous glimpses of these two great American
humorists during their several sojourns in Europe
have come to us almost wholly through
their letters to friends at home. Of course, a
man reveals himself to a great extent in his
private correspondence and diaries, but, even so,
the picture is never complete; he cannot quite
see himself as others see him. How Twain
and Field appeared to another American in
their strange environment is here set down for
the first time.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span></p>

<p><i>Fisher was in a unique position for contact
with these men, both of whom he had met previously
in the United States. He was one of the
most widely known American correspondents
in foreign parts; he had written for the Dalziel
News Company (then a sort of United
Press, dealing with the European continent)
letters from Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Copenhagen,
Belgrade, Vienna, Budapest, etc., that
were telegraphed all over the world. He had
acted as correspondent for the New York Telegram,
the New York World, the New York Sun,
the London Evening News, the Paris Messenger
and the St. James Gazette; he had written
special articles for Harper’s Weekly, printed
alongside of Mark Twain’s contributions. He
knew, or at least had a smattering knowledge
of, all European languages; he knew every
European capital or resort by eyesight and insight;
he had met the great personages of Europe.
So it was quite in the nature of things that
Mark and Field ran across Fisher at the common
meeting places in foreign parts, the U. S.
Embassies and Legations; likewise that these
American writers accepted his guidance in the
strange world they found themselves in.</i></p>

<p><i>Paine, Twain’s great biographer, speaks of
Fisher’s contact with the famous author (vol.
II, p. 935, “Mark Twain: A Biography”).
Fisher’s memory, trained by years of interviewing,
when no notes could be taken in the
presence of the interviewed, has retained the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
substance and the manner, if not always the
exact language, used and exchanged.</i></p>

<p><i>Some writers reveal themselves only in their
written, carefully edited works, but Twain’s
unique personality was as eminent, as inspiring
and as lasting in his daily walks and talks
as in his books and lectures. In so far as
Fisher reproduces the meaning of Twain’s observations
on persons and things abroad, these
anecdotes are of value to all friends and admirers
of the great humorist. The same applies to
Eugene Field, though, of course, in a more
limited degree.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>To begin with, of course, I don’t claim that
<i>all</i> these stories are absolutely first hand. I
sometimes jotted down what I heard Mark say,
or stored his talk in some compartment of
memory, only to hear him repeat the yarn,
after a space, in quite different fashion.</p>

<p>“You remind me of Charles II,” I said to
him once, referring to that confusing habit
of his, and was going to “substantiate” when
he interrupted.</p>

<p>“I can guess what you mean, but never
mind, for all you know I may be Charlie’s
reincarnation. Charles, you wanted to say,
had only three stories up his sleeve and these
he told over and over again for new ones to
Nell and the rest of the bunch. And varied
them so cleverly and disguised them so well,
that his audience never got on to the fact that
His Majesty had been chestnutting. As for
me, I can only hope that I will succeed as
well as Charlie did.”</p>

<p>In Berlin I once heard Susie Clemens—ill-fated,
talented girl, who died so young—say
to her father: “Grouchy again! They <i>do</i>
say that you can be funny when company
is around—too bad that you don’t consider
Henry Fisher company.”</p>

<p>“Out of the mouth of sucklings,” quoth
Clemens and gave Susie the twenty marks
she was after, and he kissed her: “Good-by,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
little blackmailer, and don’t tell your mamma
how you worked that fool papa of yours.”</p>

<p>Indeed, Mark was not always the humorist
the public mind pictures him. Very often,
for long hours at a time, in our intercourse
extending over thirty years, he was decidedly
serious, while at other times he grumbled at
everything and everybody. His initial object
in choosing me for his “bear-leader” was to
add to his stock of knowledge on foreign
affairs and to correct erroneous ideas he might
have acquired from books. Since I had resided
many years on the Continent, and had command
of the languages he lacked, he asked
me to pilot him around Berlin, Paris, and
Vienna, and on such occasions his talk was
more often deep and learned than laughter-provoking.
In an afternoon or morning’s
work—getting atmosphere, <i>i. e.</i>, “the hang
of things” German or Austrian, as Mark
called it—he sometimes dropped two or three
memorable witticisms, but familiar intercourse
in the long run left no doubt of the
fact that a very serious vein bordering on
melancholy underlay his mask of bonhomie.
On the other hand a closer or more intelligent
student of life never lived. He was
as conscientious, as true, and as simple as
Washington Irving.</p>

<p>Those occasional lapses into dejection notwithstanding,
it struck me that Mark extracted
his humor out of the bounty and abundance
of his own nature. Hence his tinkling grotesquerie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
unconventionality, whimsicality,
play of satire, and shrieking irony, between
touches of deep seriousness.</p>

<p>Really much of Mark’s wisdom began and
ended in humor and vice versa. There was
originality and penetration in everything he
said. Howells has said of Mark: “If a trust
of his own was betrayed—Clemens was ruthlessly,
implacably resentful.” For my part,
in thirty years, I never heard him speak ill
of any living person, except one or two self-appointed
editors.</p>

<p>I first met him in Chicago during the Grant
celebration, November, 1879, when I heard
him give the toast on babies, but I do not
remember a word of his speech, for while it
lasted I was sitting next to Grant and Grant
kept me busy watching and attending his
immutable and eloquent silence.</p>

<p>When Mark and I were fellow correspondents
in Berlin, I met his wife and family
frequently at their home, at the Hotel Royal,
and on public occasions. The three girls, Jean,
Susie, and Clara, were in their teens, and both
lovely and lively. At that time the late William
Walter Phelps of New Jersey was American
minister in Berlin. We had been friends
in America and Phelps had also known Mr.
Clemens in the States socially. Like everybody
else, he delighted in Mark’s stimulating
company. Among other distinguished Americans
in Berlin, in 1891, was Ward Hill Lamon,
Abraham Lincoln’s Springfield law partner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
later his private secretary, and Marshal of
the District of Columbia during Lincoln’s
administration. Lamon was the author of
“The Life of Abraham Lincoln” and “Recollections
of Abraham Lincoln.” These books
the Lincoln family did not enjoy.</p>

<p>When the Clemenses went to live in Vienna,
six years later, I happened to be correspondent
at the Austrian capital for Dalziel’s News,
London, and Galignani’s Messenger, Paris,
and as Mark, used to the Berlin dialect, found
it difficult “to acclimatize his German, making
it chime in with the Vienna variety” (his
own description), I was again much in demand
as interpreter, pathfinder, and general cicerone.</p>

<p>In later years I met Mark repeatedly during
his several London seasons, for, liking his
society, I called at Brown’s or his apartment
whenever he came to England, myself being
engaged in literary work there. We were
never on terms of particular intimacy—hail-fellows-well-met,
yes! “Hello, Mark”—“Hello
Henry W.—you here again?” We stuck
verbally to the formula of the old Chicago
days, and I was glad to be of use to him when
it suited his fancy. Moreover, I was vastly
interested in Mark’s books, short stories, and
essays, but found him rarely inclined to talk
shop unless it was the other fellow’s.</p>

<p>Rudyard Kipling he used to designate “the
militant spokesman of the Anglo-Saxon races,”
and he sometimes spoke with near-admiration
of Bernard Shaw, “whose plays are popular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
from London to St. Petersburg, from Christiania
to Madrid, from Havre to Frisco, and
from Frisco to the Antipodes, while mine are
nowhere.”</p>

<p>After I visited Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana
he said to me: “Lucky dog, you have broken
bread with the man who commands, and
almost monopolizes, the thought of the
world.”</p>

<p>That the universality of his humor and its
humanity made him the peer of these great
writers, of all his contemporaries in fact,
seemed to be far from his thoughts. His
verbal humor, like his fancy, was as simple
in form and as direct in application as were
the army orders of the great Napoleon. He
liked to hear me say that, for he knew that
some of my forbears had been individually
attached to the person of the Emperor. But
the most he ever said concerning his authorship
and other writers in his own line was
this:</p>

<p>“I pity the fellow who has to create a
dialect or paraphrase the dictionary to get
laughs. Like you and Susie” (referring to his
oldest daughter) “I can’t spell, but I have
never stooped to spell cat with a ‘k’ to get
at your funny bone. I love a drink, but I
never encouraged drunkenness by harping on
its alleged funny side.”</p>

<p>One more of his sayings: At the unveiling
of a bronze tablet to Eugene Field, Mark
uttered these words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span></p>

<p>“By his life he made bright the lives of all
who knew him and by his books he cheered
the thoughts of thousands who didn’t know
him.”</p>

<p>Substitute “millions” for thousands and
you have Mark Twain the Man and Mark
Twain the Writer.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>One afternoon, having laughed our fill with
the “Belle of New York” and rejoiced in the
London success of the piece (Mark, who
while alive enjoyed scant luck as a playwright,
yet loved to see others “win out”),
our friend and the present writer happened
to cross Bedford Square. Seeing the name
at a street corner, Mark pulled out his notebook.
“Eugene Field lived somewhere around
here in 1889,” he said. I showed him the
house, No. 20 Alfred Street.</p>

<p>“A dark and dismal hole,” said Mark,
ruefully shaking his head; “no wonder he
couldn’t find his ‘righteous stomach’ there,
even in the absence of Chicago pies.”</p>

<p>“And <i>coffee</i>,” I interpolated. “Yours truly,
too, would have died of dyspepsia if he had
stayed in Chicago and continued at Henrici’s
coffee and pie counter, as Gene did.”</p>

<p>Mark remained silent for a block or two.
“I’ve got it,” he said at last, “God gave Gene
a good enough stomach, and English hospitality
completely paralyzed what was left of his
digestive powers after the Cook County coffee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
and pie diet. Did you see much of Gene
while he was in London?”</p>

<p>I told Mark all I knew about Field’s social
and literary doings. “Bennett was right when
he refused him a job on the London Herald,”
said Clemens. “For one thing, the Herald
didn’t last long, and the English climate would
have cut poor Gene’s life still shorter by two
or three winters and falls.”</p>

<p>Just the same, the desire for a London success,
then common among American writers
and artists, killed Eugene Field, the genial
and lovable poet of childhood and man-about-literature’s-highways-and-byways.</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” said Mark Twain,
in pajamas and dressing gown, lolling in his
big armchair at Brown’s (“the only subdued
and homelike inn left in London,” he used
to call it)—“not if you bring the Bath Club
(and tub) right into this suite so I don’t have
to shock my good English friends by painting
the town blue skipping across Dover
Street in my dressing gown. By the way,”
he added, winking an eye at Bram Stoker,
“my daughter Clara bought me this—” (he
held up the skirts of his bathrobe with
both hands) “a most refined girl! If she
wasn’t, would she have sent me a wire like
this?</p>

<p>“‘Much worried by newspapers. Remember
proprieties.’”</p>

<p>“And what did you answer?” asked Bram.</p>

<p>“None of your business! You are getting
as fresh as a reporter,” snapped Twain, with
mock severity, while looking at me.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I consulted my notebook.
“It’s sixteen years since the Kaiser—” I reopened
the case—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, I have a notebook too. Wait a
minute,” interrupted Twain. He gave his
secretary directions, and presently read from
an old, much worn diary, sustaining my
date-line as it were—</p>

<p>“... since this democratic lamb and the
Imperial lion laid down together, a little
General providing grub—”</p>

<p>“Sixteen years is a long time, and if
the Kaiser imposed silence upon you then
and there, the lid is certainly off now,”
I insisted. “Besides, at present, he’s got
Nietzsche on the brain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether Annie Besant and
William Jennings Bryan occupy lofts in his
upper story,” said Twain. “I had promised
Von Versen” (the General and Mark’s relation)
“not to talk about that jamboree, and the
worms, if interested, will have to turn burglars
and jimmy my brain cells, where memories of
the banquet are stored, for I swear I’ll leave
no skeleton key.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You are still sore because Willie
wouldn’t let you get in a word edgewise,”
said Stoker.</p>

<p>“Man alive!” cried Twain, “his talk was
selling books for me. I was in rotten bad
shape then financially, doing syndicate work
for ‘The Sun’ and ‘McClure’s’. Could I afford
to say, ‘Can your talk, Willie’?—like poverty,
they have you with them always—but I am
here for a short time only—my turn to stir up
the animals.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>We agreed that if an emperor climbs the
dizzy heights of bookmongerdom he ought to
have all the rope he wants.</p>

<p>“And did you like the British better than
the Berlin brand of king?” was asked.</p>

<p>“They let me do a lot of talking at Windsor,”
evaded honest Mark. “I like these
folks immensely. Ed is a manly fellow, despite
his Hoboken accent—no wonder he
fought with his ma, who wore the pants while
Albert was alive, and tried to impose her
German policies on her successor-to-be. Ed
recalled an indigestion which we both entertained
at Homburg, at the Elizabeth Spa
there, which is more kinds of pure salt than
Kissingen even. The blonde Fräulein who had
sold us the liquid caviar advised walking it
off, and as stomachache inclines to democracy
the same as toothache, I didn’t mind tramping
with Ed, though I fancied that I would hear
more about royal inner works than was decent
for a minister’s son.”</p>

<p>“Did you tell the King any yarns?”</p>

<p>“Well, he referred to my giving out that
interview about the news of my death being
greatly exaggerated, and was pleased to call
it funny. When I said that everybody more
or less was given to overstatement, Ed commented,
dryly, ‘Especially my nephew of Germany.’
So I told the story of the Russian Jew
who claimed to have been chased by 47 wolves.</p>

<p>“‘You probably were so frightened you
saw double,’ suggested the magistrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“‘There were 12 at least,’ insisted Isaac.</p>

<p>“‘Won’t half a dozen do?’</p>

<p>“‘As I live, there were seven.’</p>

<p>“‘Now tell the truth, Isaac. There was
one wolf—one is enough to frighten a little
Israelite like you.’</p>

<p>“Isaac, glad of saving one out of 47, nodded.</p>

<p>“‘But maybe the creature wasn’t a wolf at
all!’</p>

<p>“‘No wolf!’ cried Isaac, ‘what else could
he be? Didn’t he have four legs, and didn’t
he wag his tail?’</p>

<p>“After that Ed turned me over to the
Queen and a tribe of Princes and Princesses,
who all seemed much relieved when I solemnly
informed them that I had no intention of buying
Windsor Castle this trip. Then we talked
commonplaces until Alexandra commanded
me to put on my hat lest I catch cold, which
gave me a chance to tell about Will Penn.
Penn, you’ll remember, insisted on wearing
his hat everywhere. When he saw King
Charles, the second of his name, doff his
chapeau at a court function, the future Philadelphian
inquired:</p>

<p>“‘Friend Charles, why dost thou take off
thy lid?’</p>

<p>“‘Because,’ answered Charles, ‘it is customary
at court that only one may remain
covered in the King’s presence.’</p>

<p>“I was ashamed, cracking that chestnut,”
said Mark, “but Alexandra and the youngsters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
seemed to think it a real side-splitter to judge
by the noise they made.”</p>

<p>“Nice people,” said Bram.</p>

<p>“You bet,” spoke Mark emphatically,
“and that’s why I’ll have a word or two with
the War Office of this here realm before I quit.
I have been thinking, you know. When we
got through with the grub at General Versen’s
and retired to the smoking room, that Kaiser,
in the meantime reinforced by a lot of his
officers that came in for beer, pretzels and
cigars—that Kaiser worked himself up into a
fine frenzy about his U-boats. His Germania
Shipyards at Kiel (they were really Krupps,
but he was the principal stockholder) would
turn out better and bigger U-boats, he
said, than the French and English could ever
hope to build. And when he had enough of
them, with all the improvements science and
technique could provide—then beware, proud
Albion!</p>

<p>“Invasion was the least he threatened unless
England helped him exterminate France.</p>

<p>“‘It was the easiest thing in the world,’
boasted William, ‘a hundred U-boats operating
against England, Scotland and Ireland
simultaneously could pull off the trick in a
day or two.’”</p>

<p>Mark lit a fresh cigar, tilted his feet as high
as the chiffonier allowed and developed what
he was pleased to call his “strategy.”</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, “the waters ’round
these islands are charted to the last half pint.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
The British Admiralty knows the bottom as
well as the surface and the coast. Now suppose
Willie or any other divinely Appointed
One (I don’t think, though, there is another
as foolish and reckless as he) should attempt
to carry out that invasion threat. Mind, its
possibilities are not denied by British strategists;
I have made inquiries. Now, to meet
invasion in the old orthodox way would
cost a million lives, a thousand millions in
treasure, and, after all, the result would be
problematical.</p>

<p>“To make defeat of the invasion plans certain,
we must forestall execution. And the
only way to do that is to stew those U-boats
in their own electric fat—juice, I mean. See
my point?”</p>

<p>Bram and I said we did, “but—” and
Twain, knowing that we were lying like
thieves, explained:</p>

<p>“In time of peace, et cetera.... In this case
(I will have the device patented, of course) we
will build a steel fence all around the three
kingdoms, height to be determined by local
conditions. In all cases it will be so graduated
as to allow the biggest ocean liner to pass over,
yet high enough to bar the biggest and the
smallest U-boat pirate. Are you on?” asked
Mark.</p>

<p>Bram said he was, but I couldn’t tell another
lie before luncheon.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way, you duffer,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Mark, “somewhere, everywhere on the English,
Scottish and Irish coasts, immense dynamos
will be established—these with no fancy
brushes, mark you—to connect with certain
points of my steel fence by naked cables.</p>

<p>“The British Admiralty will know, of
course, when the U-boat armada sets out, and
will turn on the current when and where it will
do the most harm. Now the moment a U-boat
touches my fence, out of business it goes, goes
for good, but at the same time its agony will
start. For my fence will be magnetized as
well as electrified, and though the U-boat is
momentarily repulsed, it is held, at the same
time, captive by a giant magnet.</p>

<p>“Think of the fine time the enemy crew will
have,” chuckled Twain, “with ten thousands
of volts pumped into their vessel at the bottom
of the sea, the magnet preventing its getaway.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he continued, “I would like to sit
on top of Big Ben” (in the tower of Parliament
House, London) “and direct the electric
strokes myself.”</p>

<p>“And this epoch-making invention of yours,
will you present it to Great Britain as a free
gift?”</p>

<p>“Not I,” said Twain. “I have a family to
look after. I intend to get a round million
sterling from the War Office here. And if the
British refuse to pay, why, when you come to
think of it, we have quite a long coast line in
the United States—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>While Mark was speaking, Sir Thomas Lipton
came in with a newspaper poster, four
days old, that read:</p>

<p>Mark had attended a masked ball at the
Berlin Palace and was asked what he thought
of William Hohenzollern dressed up as Frederick
the Great. “He reminded me of the
little speech addressed by a Cossack Chief to
Orloff, the lover of Catharine of Russia.
Orloff visited the chief wearing a French
court costume. The Cossack began to laugh.</p>

<p>“‘What is there to laugh at?’ demanded
Orloff in a rage.</p>

<p>“‘I laugh because you shaved your face to
look young and put flour in your hair to look
old—both things at the same time,’ replied
the Barbarian.</p>

<p>“As to William, he reminded me of still
another thing; namely, the thigh-bone of a
Saint I was introduced to in Italy and which,
they said, belonged to a famous preacher of
old. I turned the bone, which was encased in
glass, gold and precious stones, over and over,
yet could get no notion of the quality of its
original owner’s sermons.”</p>

</div>


<p>“I have been reading up on the laws dealing
with regicide,” I heard Mark Twain tell Minister
Phelps one morning in dead seriousness,
“and do you know what they are going to do
with me? Three or four things.</p>

<p>“First, they will cut my right hand off, and
then hit me on the mouth with it, by way of
reproof, I suppose. Second, they’ll hari-kari
me and build a little fire to do my insides
brown—all the time keeping me alive for the
rest of the show. That will take some stimulants,
I reckon.</p>

<p>“Third, they’ll hang me by the neck until I
am stone dead. Whether I will get my inards
and my hand back before they send me to
wormland, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“What <i>are</i> you talking about?” queried
Mr. Phelps.</p>

<p>“Why, you made me admit yesterday to
Count Seckendorff that the judge who sent
Charles the First to the block was a near relative
of mine. Now, as soon as Willie hears
about that, he will have my hands, my inards
or anything else he craves of my anatomy.”</p>

<p>Of course, everybody roared, and Mr.
Phelps had to explain that at dinner the night
before, one of the guests, the nobleman mentioned,
who was the favorite of the Empress
Frederick, had boasted a lot of his ancestry;
grandfathers and uncles of his had been present
at every great battle the world over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
had, of course, always fought on the winning
side. Later, when the company was looking
at some engravings, Mr. Phelps, in a joke,
pointed to the figure of a Puritan, saying, with
a merry twinkle in his eye:</p>

<p>“Ancestor of mine.”</p>

<p>The picture happened to illustrate the trial
of Charles the First of England. Now, not to
be outdone, Twain pointed to the Lord Judge
on the woolsack, and matched Phelps’ lie.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> ancestor, if you please.” He made
the statement at the very moment when
Count Seckendorff looked at the picture.
Hence, Mark’s awful apprehensions.</p>

<p>“Regicide,” he told us, “is never outlawed
by the lapse of time. When Charles the
First’s son was restored to the throne, hundreds
of dead regicides were pulled out of their
graves by the ears and hanged and quartered.
As to the living, they were treated as I described,
and I am afraid that if Seckendorff
reports me (Willie being half English) I will
be punished just as if I had made Charles a
head shorter myself, yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FUNNIEST_SPEECH_MARK_EVER">THE FUNNIEST SPEECH MARK EVER
HEARD</h2>
</div>


<p>“The funniest thing I ever heard was
chirped right here in this neighborhood,” said
Mark Twain, snuggling down in his big armchair
before the fire, which wasn’t blazing, and
“didn’t mean to—without kerosene” (he told
the maid, warning her not to let the “Missus”
know).</p>

<p>The “neighborhood” was Tedworth Square,
London, “quite the other side of Mayfair,”
and leading to some queer streetlets and lanes.</p>

<p>“London’s Fifth Avenues,” mused Mark,
“remind me of a sable coat (such as Pauline
Bonaparte used to wear) edged with cat-skin:
There are always Hell-kitchens within hailing
distance.</p>

<p>“Well, at that time my girls had a friend
living in Clapham, and nightly she walked me
ten or more blocks to her bus through one of
those Hell-kitchens lined with fried-fish shops
and other ill-smelling emporiums for acquisitioning
lucre.”</p>

<p>He turned to an English friend:</p>

<p>“Maybe ‘lined’ isn’t correct, for the fish
shops were all on one side of the lane, and
naturally I ambled along the other. I thought
I was safe there, but of course I wasn’t, for the
smells zigzagged across the pavement and
followed me like a rotten conscience. My
haven of safety, or comparative safety, from
the rancid oil compost was an undertaker’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
shop at the lane’s extreme end. When I got
there, I used to hoist up my coat-tails and
skip across the street right into the Public
’Ouse opposite for a Scotch. Naturally I took
more or less interest in that cemetery-correspondence
school. From a notice posted, I
learned that it was under ‘new management’—I
call that an ingenious appeal for corpses,
don’t you?</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t merely an office, the carpentry
was right at the tail of the roll topper;
there, night after night, an old, sad-faced man
sat, looking for customers. Now, the English
metropolis is reputed the healthiest city in the
world, which proves that the legend about
cleanliness being nearest to godliness is blooming
rot, for London is ten times dirtier than
Berlin, seven and a half times dirtier than
New York and six times dirtier than the best
parts of Paris. Anyhow, that man-hyena,
hungry for worm-food, didn’t enjoy the low
rate of mortality one single bit. I could see
that every time I eyed him, and I lamped him
regularly before I waltzed into the gin-mill to
drown the fried-fish smell.”</p>

<p>“And did <i>one</i> Scotch suffice for the operation?”
asked Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>Mark looked at Mrs. Clemens and lied
brazenly: “Yes, of course.” But as she had
risen to go out and was walking toward the
door, he added in an undertone: “One Scotch
was like taking a bottle of perfume from the
ten-cent store into a glue factory to paralyze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the Cologne smell of a four-acre establishment
of that sort.”</p>

<p>“To resume,” resumed Mark, “seeing each
other nightly for a week or a week and a half,
that undertaker chap and this here yellow
journalist of literature got on famously, and
our acquaintance, though by eyesight only,
gradually blossomed into real brotherhood.
Whenever I clapped eyes on the poor devil,
I used to think: ‘I <i>do</i> wish some one would
have the heart to die. Why don’t the Gloomy
Dean or His Grace of Canterbury oblige the
poor shark?’</p>

<p>“And no doubt, observing my gray locks
and general decrepitude, he calculated: ‘Time
for him to kick the bucket—hope his wife will
give me a chance to measure him for a ten-guinea
wooden coat—yes, he looks good for
ten guineas.’</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Mark, “I felt in my heart
of hearts that I was worth more dead than
alive to this person—rotten grammar, I know,
but don’t let that muss up your tempers,
gents—and while the idea of suicide was repugnant
(I was making big money then, that
is, I expected to rake in $100.00 or more next
week) still I cudgeled my brain for ways and
means to improve his business. It’s easy
enough to promote a grocer’s or butcher’s
trade; all you have to do is to get rid of your
sour stomach at some Appetite Cure Factory,
and pitch in anew with dill pickles and strong
coffee and frankfurters and sweetbreads and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
deep-dish pies. But an undertaker’s! Really,
I had no desire to pose for Madame Toussaud’s
dead-uns. At the same time, no doggone
friend of mine would die, giving me the
chance to bury him at my expense. Running
away from that fried-fish smell, I always felt
like Henry the Eighth, when one of his half-dozen
queens wouldn’t be introduced to the
axe-man. Indeed, if that starving undertaker
had been my own best enemy, I couldn’t have
felt more sorry for him. But lo!—the silver
lining to the cloud! One evening, as I approached
the carcassery, my startled ears
were assailed by that quaint ditty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For we are the drunkenest lot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the drunken Irish crew—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and, leaping forward like oiled lightning, I saw
the undertaker at work in the rear of the shop.</p>

<p>“‘Bless me, if the ban isn’t broke,’ I
thought, ‘and with this dent in the armor,
Fate will waltz up plenty more diseased ones.
It’s always thus.’</p>

<p>“Suiting my action to the classic monologue—‘thus’
is a beautiful word, isn’t it?—I
peered through the side window, expecting the
janitor of tenements-of-clay to be at work on
a nine-foot coffin or thereabout—”</p>

<p>All the merriment fled from Mark Twain’s
face and manner when he added: “Damme,
if that God-forsaken corpse-slinger was not
planing a <i>baby coffin</i>!</p>

<p>“That night I took three Scotch, and”
(looking around) “I don’t care if Livy knows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“I thought you were going to tell a <i>funny</i>
one,” said one of us, after a while. Clemens
had got rid of his emotion by that time. “Correct,”
he drawled, “It happened a few days
later, when I was working the fried-fish side of
the lane. The street was quite deserted on
account of the lateness of the hour and owing
to the burial of herrings and crab-meat in
innumerable stomachs, big and little. As I
put on extra steam to reach the gin-mill before
closing time, this pretty legend wafted across
the moonbeams:</p>

<p>“‘I say, my little female doggie’ (as a
matter of fact, the shorter and uglier word
was used, but it isn’t good form, though one
may mention ‘bull pups’ at Mrs. Van Astorbilt’s
tea) ‘I say, my little female doggie, tell
Mother if she has another litter by that
crossing sweeper of hers, to take care to
drown ’em before they grow up as big as
you.’</p>

<p>“The lady speaking, or rather shrieking,
repeated this admonition three or four times,
and followed it up with a succession of oaths
that I frankly envied her. Yes, indeed, her
‘female doggie,’ her ‘crossing sweeper,’ her
‘litter,’ and her brand of blasphemy filled me
with obscene delight, and I chuckled over
them for a week.”</p>

<p>After the laughter had subsided, Richard
Harding Davis asked: “And what is a crossing
sweeper, pray?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“A compound of rags and dirt, fitted with a
face and feet and a broom, who mops up the
dirty pavement to save your spats, and curses
you for a curmudgeon if you give him less
than a ha’penny for his trouble.”</p>

</div>


<p>One day in Berlin, speaking of General
Grant, Mark said, “I did not admire him so
much for winning the war as for <i>ending</i> the
war. Peace—happiness—brotherhood—that
is what we want in this world.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the Kaiser,” he continued,
“and sends me tickets for his September review.
Of course I will go. But I don’t care
for military spectacles, or for militarism.
Tolstoy was right in calling army life ‘a school
for murder.’ In Germany to-day there are
ten million men drilled to look upon the Kaiser
as a god. And if the Kaiser says ‘kill’—they
kill. And if he says ‘die for me’—they go out
and get themselves shot. The blame and
shame rest with the big and little war lords.
As to the German people, mere subjects, they
have eighteen or twenty centuries of monarchical
atavism in their blood.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DEMOCRATIC_MARK_AND_THE">DEMOCRATIC MARK AND THE
AUSTRIAN ARISTOCRACY</h2>
</div>


<p>Mark Twain was essentially a democrat,
and the nobles he met in Berlin and other
parts of Germany never cured him of that fine
habit. But in Vienna he grew less exclusive
and in the end actually liked to mix with high
aristocrats. “The Prussian noble,” he once
explained at the Metropole, “walks and acts
as if he had swallowed the stick they used to
beat him with when a youngster—I stole the
simile somewhere, but never mind—however,
the Vienna brand of aristocrat is different.
Maybe Austrian nobles are just as stuck-up
on account of their ancestry, but they have the
good sense not to let their pride be seen. They
all treat me cordially, talk agreeably and seem
to possess at least a stock of superficial information.
The Princess Pauline Metternich, in
particular, is a bully old girl. If she were to
write her memoirs, the world would gain a
book as bright as Mme. de Sévigné’s Letters.
For one thing I would like to have seen her
husband’s face when he learned that she made
him sign his own death warrant.</p>

<p>“Prince Metternich, as Austrian ambassador
in Paris, used to sign any and every paper
his secretaries put before him, as he was much
too indolent to read them. To cure him of
this habit, Pauline one fine day laid a document
on his desk, ordering that he, the Prince,
be taken out and shot at sunrise. Metternich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
promptly put his name to it without reading
a line. Next morning at five, several male
friends of His Highness rang the bell at the
Palace and demanded to be taken up to the
bedroom. They wore Austrian uniforms and
made an awful racket with their swords.
Metternich stormed from his bed to see what
the row was and then and there the death
warrant was read to him. He fainted. Indeed
they had a big time snatching him from the
brink of the grave, for he was near frightened
to death.</p>

<p>“Some jocular wife, eh?” chuckled Mark.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PHIL_SHERIDANS_FRIEND">PHIL SHERIDAN’S FRIEND</h2>
</div>


<p>“Jenny Stubel,” mused Mark over the
“Berliner Tageblatt” at the Cafe Bauer,
“Jenny Stu—, there is a yarn about that girl
in the back of my head, but what it is I cannot
for the life of me make out.”</p>

<p>“What has she done now?” I queried.
“Marriage or divorce, set a theatre afire, or
made away with one of those stupid archdukes
flourishing in Vienna?”</p>

<p>“Half-correct,” said Twain, “an archduke
abducted Jenny. But how did you come so
near guessing it?”</p>

<p>“I was Jenny’s manager in the early eighties
when she and her sister Lori headed the Vienna
operetta company. In fact, I introduced her
to Grover Cleveland—”</p>

<p>“And Phil Sheridan?” demanded Twain.</p>

<p>“Sheridan, Joaquin Miller, Henry Watterson
and the rest.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get this story pat first,” said Mark,
shoving the paper over to me. “Chances are
I have it upside down. Let me have the facts
and keep the trimmings for some other day.”</p>

<p>The “facts” told the now well-nigh forgotten
story that (some time in October, 1891)
the archduke John Salvator of Austria had
renounced his title and dignities, had assumed
the name of John Orth, bought a four-masted
schooner and, as her captain, went sailing the
Atlantic and Pacific in company with Jenny
Stubel, the operetta star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“‘Tall, yellow-haired, lots of quicksilver
in her system,’ that’s how Sheridan sized up
Jenny. Right, you say? Well, then, her archduke
wasn’t so very foolish, after all, particularly
as she was a sweet singer, a nimble dancer
and all that. Did you say you introduced her
to Grover Cleveland?”</p>

<p>“Sure, at one of the public afternoon receptions,
when everybody went to shake hands
with the President.”</p>

<p>“General Sheridan was quite taken with
Jenny,” continued Twain. “He told me he
went to the show night after night and didn’t
care how much he applauded her young beauty
and fascinating voice. Yes, Phil was really
smitten with Jenny. And now the admired of
the most famous General of Horse defies the
world to become an acknowledged royal mistress,
and her sprig of royalty the black sheep
of a crowned family by no means lily-white at
that. She reminds me of old Field Marshal
Prince de Ligne, making love to a very young
girl and succeeding, or nearly succeeding,
before he had time to reflect.</p>

<p>“‘A million,’ cried the Field Marshal,
‘if I was a lieutenant now.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ELIZABETH_WAS_A_HE_SAID_MARK">“ELIZABETH WAS A HE,” SAID MARK</h2>
</div>


<p>“Mark my word, Elizabeth was a <i>he</i>,” said
Clemens, when I was starting for London the
end of June, 1894, leaving the Clemenses at
the Normandie, Paris, “and when you have a
little time in England, I wish you would look
up all that pesky question for me.”</p>

<p>“Not in Westminster Abbey?” I cried in
alarm.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t <i>you</i> try to be gay,” said Mark.
“It’s bad enough if <i>I</i> got that reputation when
I want to be taken seriously. I know they
haven’t got through ascertaining for the
’teenth time whether Charles I really lost his
head when his overbearing noddle dropped
into the basket on the scaffold opposite the
Horse-Guards—you showed me the spot yourself.
I don’t want any ghoulish work done.
Just go to the British Museum and every
other library and nose up everything appertaining
to Queen Elizabeth’s manly character.
You get the authorities (for a consideration, of
course) and I’ll do the rest. Then you go
down Surrey-way and find a place or castle or
summer house called Overcourt, or something.
That’s where Elizabeth lived in her teens, and
metamorphosed into a boy.”</p>

<p>“But the editor will never allow you to
write on such a subject. Better let me do it.”</p>

<p>“Not on your life,” said Mark. “It’s <i>my</i>
discovery, and I’m paying you for the work
you do, just as the New York ‘World’ and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
‘Sun’ do. When you come down to hard
tacks you will find that there are no questionable
proceedings whatever, just an exchange
of babies, as in the old-time operas, Troubadour
and the rest. The Editor will have no
kick coming.”</p>

<p>“The Editor,” of course, was Mrs. Clemens,
who as a rule censored Mark’s manuscript—“tooth-combed
it,” as he called it, cutting out
such gems as “the affairs of the Cat who had a
family in every Port.”</p>

<p>Mark told me that when he got through
with “Joan of Arc” he would tackle “this
here Elizabeth proposition”—“a person full
of placid egotism and obsessed with self-importance,”
he called her. “If I do Elizabeth
half as well as I intend to do ‘Joan’ and did
‘The Prince and Pauper,’ I will have three
serious books to my credit, and after that I
will be damned—‘thrice damned,’ Elizabeth
would have said—if I allow anybody to take
me for a mere funmaker.”</p>

<p>He gave me some more instructions, talking
at random mostly, and paid me in advance for
the work I was to do. Twenty-four hours
later I landed at Victoria Station, London,
for, having business in Antwerp, I had travelled
via Holland.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A foreign correspondent (that was my trade
then) is shifted merrily from one place to
another; so it happened that I went back to
France after a fortnight in England, or even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
sooner. The Clemenses were packing, and I
had Mark all to myself for an hour or so.</p>

<p>“What made you first doubt the Virgin
Queen’s sex?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Never mind—her gorgeous swearing maybe.
What did you find out in Surrey?”</p>

<p>I duly reported that I had gone to Overcourt
with a friend, had explored the Queen
Elizabeth chambers, the woods and countryside,
and had interviewed a lot of old and some
young gossips, with this result:</p>

<p>Elizabeth, I was told, came to Overcourt
when a child of four or five, and a young person
supposed to be Elizabeth—that is, the
daughter of Ann Boleyn and Henry the
Eighth—left there some ten years later. When
the Princess was seven or eight, King Henry,
who was attending Parliament, had promised
to come and see his little girl two weeks hence
(Overcourt is within easy riding distance of
London). But even as they were preparing to
give Hal—(“Ought to be Hell,” interpolated
Mark)—a rousing reception; to feed the brute
in particular, Elizabeth was suddenly attacked
by malignant fever and died. There was only
one “in the know,” her Grace’s governess—I
gave her name to Mark, but have quite forgotten
it. I remember, though, that she remained
in the royal service for some forty
years afterwards, in fact, that she and “Elizabeth”
never separated while both lived.</p>

<p>“I can imagine how that poor woman felt,”
commented Mark—“went through all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
horrors of having her hair bobbed behind, and
her neck shaved—what else was there in store
for her but a beheading party if Hal found his
daughter dead? And when, in your mind’s
eye, you see the executioner try the edge of his
axe on his thumb nail, life’s delicatessen—considerations
for truth, politics, and common
everyday decency—lose their appeal. The
axe-man was coming and that governess didn’t
want to be the chicken.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the gossips told me, and they
had it from their great-great-great-grandmothers,
a blessed heritage.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Mark.</p>

<p>“Well, that governess knew that her life
depended upon finding a substitute for Elizabeth,
and the substitute couldn’t materialize
quickly enough. Briefly, it did materialize in
the person of the late Princess’ boy playmate—here
are his name and affiliations, as Overcourt
neighborhood has it.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Mark, “the rest I know or can
imagine. She dressed up that kid in Elizabeth’s
petticoats and togs and frightened the
life out of him not to betray her or himself
with the King or any one else.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” mused Mark, “for the eighth
Henry was an ogre—the very unborn children
of England knew it. Besides, reading up the
official history of Elizabeth, I find that Hal
hadn’t seen his daughter for three or four
years previous to his visit in Overcourt. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
deception, then, worked easily enough. <i>I</i>
could have done it at a pinch.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mark next went into the life history of the
great Queen, or supposed Queen. “She was
a male character all over—a thousand acts of
hers prove it,” he insisted. “Now tell me
what were the conspicuous Tudor traits—”</p>

<p>“But you said she wasn’t a Tudor,” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Precisely, but she had to copy the Tudors
as our stage impersonators imitate Bernhardt
and Henry Dixie. Now what were those
Tudor traits: remorselessness, cunning, lying
till the cows come home, murder, robbery,
despoliation! All of them Elizabeth, or the
man who impersonated the Queen, practiced
to the dotlet on the <i>i</i>. Think of the letters she
wrote to Francis Drake, the inventor of fried
potatoes, and to the second Philip of Spain.
Wasn’t that a man’s game? Could woman ever
get up anything so misleading and contraband?</p>

<p>“And the way she fooled her English, Spanish,
Austrian, German and French admirers,
setting each against the other, never neglecting
to threaten Spain’s flank, and, at the last,
throwing them the head of Mary of Scots as
a gage of battle—regular male strumpet’s
chicanery, I tell you.”</p>

<p>From a drawer Mark pulled a highly decorated
volume, and turned the leaves quickly.
“Elizabeth’s official lovers,” he explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
“Lord Seymour, second husband of her stepmother,
Queen Catherine Parr. Catherine,
I gather, was in the secret; otherwise she
wouldn’t have allowed Seymour to carry on
with ‘Elizabeth’ as he did. And he had about a
yard of whiskers on his face at that. There
was Leicester, this big chap here with the
goatee. She had him beheaded, not because
he knew anything against her, or about her
real sex, but because he had the <i>reputation</i> of
knowing things. The Virgin Queen made her
alleged lover a head shorter, just to show that
she didn’t care what she did. Henry and
Francis, the French Valois brothers, Dukes of
something or other, were likewise large, sinister
looking fellows. These, too, she used, man
fashion, like boobs, and as no other crowned
harridan ever used a lover. Think of Catharine
(of Russia) and of Josephine and Marie
Louise—to be loved by those ladies was real
fun, a treat.” Mark lowered his voice to add:
“I read somewhere that Catharine allowed the
brothers Orloff no less than fifty thousand
roubles pajama money—fifty thousand! One
can buy a powerful lot of nighties for that much
money, even at the Louvre, across the way.”</p>

<p>“There’s the Britannica,” continued Mark,
jumping up. He found a paragraph under the
caption of “Elizabeth” that tickled him immensely.
“Read this, and call me a liar if
you dare.”</p>

<p>The paragraph states that there was “some
physical defect” in Elizabeth’s make-up, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
she was “masculine in mind and temperament,”
likewise, that no man ever lost his
head over her as they did over Mary of Scots.</p>

<p>“’Nuff said on the score of love-making and
lying,” concluded Mark. “’Nuff for the
present, I mean; but here is another thing.
We all know there is only one Hetty Green,
that there never was another. Yet this here
Elizabeth, so called—<i>i. e.</i>, the man who impersonated
her—was as clever a financier as John
D. Rockefeller. As John D. gobbled up all the
oil in creation, or out of it, so Elizabeth, so
called, lapped up all the gold, minted and
otherwise. Up to the sixties and seventies (of
the sixteenth century) Spain had an absolute
monopoly of the yellow and white metals, you
know. When the person called Elizabeth died,
all the gold of the world was in English hands,
and, besides, England dominated all the ocean
trade routes, where formerly the Spanish flag
had been unchallenged.”</p>

<p>“As circumstantial evidence, can’t be beat,”
I suggested timidly, “but—”</p>

<p>“You remind me of the cat that bolted a
whole box of Seidlitz powders and then had
no more judgment than to lie under the open
hydrant,” exploded Mark. “Why don’t you
ask me to trot out Elizabeth in an Andy
Carnegie Highland costume, kilts and all?
There will be missing links, plenty of them,
after all these years, that goes without saying,
but it’s a great story, nevertheless. Needs a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
hunk of brain, though, to puzzle it out to its
logical conclusion.”</p>

<p>Soon after this conversation, the Clemenses
went to Italy, and for some little time I expected
to hear from Mark further on the
Elizabeth legend. But the yarn seems to have
slipped his memory, and as I found him engrossed
in matters of the moment, I didn’t try
to revive his interest in one so remote.</p>

<p>But I have often wondered whether, or not,
his many unpublished writings show that he
brought “his hunk of brains” to work on
unsexing Elizabeth.</p>

Mark Twain and Livy were staying at a nearby
watering place, but Mrs. Clemens was not
well enough to attend—or, as Mark whispered
to Mr. Phelps—was unwilling to go, being
afraid that he might disgrace the family by
some practical joke. So Mark had it all his
own way and enjoyed his freedom hugely,
keeping all in a roar.</p>

<p>Finally, Dr. Von Something-or-Other tried
to get in a word edgewise and abruptly asked
Mark what he thought of the European equilibrium.</p>

<p>(Mark said afterwards: “Knowing my
political incompetence, the Doctor probably
tried to inveigle me into making an ass of
myself.”)</p>

<p>The Herr Von’s question having been delivered
in no sotto voce style, everybody pricked
up ears to hear Mark’s answer.</p>

<p>“I can’t explain in a few words,” he said,
“but I’ll demonstrate.” And turning to Mr.
Phelps: “Hand me the Doctor’s plate, please.”</p>

<p>The Doctor looked up “disgusted,” because
he had only just commenced to eat and
was “as hungry as a dog.” Plate in hand,
Mark stepped to a space between the window
and the table and asked the Doctor to join
him, bringing his knife. “Now,” he said, “I
will throw the plate up to the ceiling and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
will catch it, on the end of your knife, but
don’t you spill anything. After catching it, you
will please keep it spinning upon the end of
your steel for five minutes, balancing it so as
not to lose a drop of sauce, a chop, or fried
murphy. And when you have performed all
these stunts without mishap, you will have
gained a correct idea of what I think of the
balance of European power.”</p>

</div>


<p>At Vienna, in the late nineties, Clemens one
fine day intoxicated himself with the idea that
there would be millions in writing a play with
Kathi Schratt, Emperor Francis Joseph’s
acknowledged mistress, as heroine. He had
in mind a collaborator among native playwrights,
and the piece was to be translated
into all living tongues. Mark actually started
on the thing, adding to his knowledge of German
as he went along. Matters having gone
so far, I persuaded him to go and see Frau
Schratt for local color.</p>

<p>“Bully,” he said. “But you must come
along. I would never trust myself alone with
a royal mistress, not I.”</p>

<p>Well, we went, saw, and—wondered at
Francis Joseph’s taste. In speech and manner,
though, the Schratt was a fine old girl. Showed
us a big houseful of presents, all gifts from his
Majesty, and elaborately so marked.</p>

<p>We had duly admired the silver bed, the
silver folding stool and the ditto cabinet,
likewise other chamber paraphernalia of white
metal, when the Schratt said: “There is one
thing more the like of which you haven’t in
America.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” ejaculated Mark, in
blasphemous German.</p>

<p>The Schratt pushed a button, a wall panel
shot sideways, and the handsomest silver-gilt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
bathtub ever came waltzing in, or rather
roller-skated in.</p>

<p>In our homeward bound fiacre, Mark remained
silent for fully ten minutes; then he
delivered himself sadly but firmly:</p>

<p>“No, it’s all off with that mellerdrammer.
For if I let Schratt ride down to the footlights
in that golden tub, people will want to see the
Empress in it, too; next they will holler for
Kaiser Bill, Sarah Bernhardt, Loie Fuller, and
William Jennings Bryan. It won’t work—people
are such hogs!”</p>

<p>And the drama was never proceeded with.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARK_ON_LYNCH_LAW">MARK ON LYNCH LAW</h2>
</div>


<p>They were talking lynch law in Professor
Krafft-Ebing’s library in Vienna—some horrible
nightmare that had come in the latest
cable—and as a matter of course Clemens
was asked his opinion as an American and
observer of human nature.</p>

<p>“Lynch law means mob-lawlessness, doesn’t
it?” he drawled. “Well, what does it argue?
To my mind it argues that men in a crowd do
not act as they would as individuals. In a
crowd they don’t think for themselves, but
become impregnated by the contagious sentiment
uppermost in the minds of all who happen
to be en masse. While in Paris last, the
family and I toured all the places of horror,
made odious during the White Terror—we
followed pretty closely the scent of the ‘Tale
of Two Cities,’ Michelet, Dumas, and others.
I was particularly interested in the ‘Official
Gazette’ of the guillotine, ‘The Moniteur,’
and my girls helped me read and digest many
tell-tale pages yellow with age and tattered
by usage. Among other interesting items, I
found recorded that on a certain date the
Nobles had voted to forego their feudal privileges.</p>

<p>“Now, their previous failure to renounce
these same rights had been one of the prime
causes of the Revolution. Yet when they
acquiesced, they were put to the knife just the
same, for mob-law ruled then. Another case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in the ‘Moniteur’: I read of a deputy named
Monge, the same whom Napoleon in his Saint
Helena talks pronounced a most lovable character,
so kind-hearted that he would never eat
any fowl if he had to kill it first. Yet in the
Convention, in the midst of the mob of his
fellows, this same Monge vociferated for unlimited
bloodshed, for ‘war to the knife.’ He
had caught the contagion and, intoxicated
with bloodthirstiness, acted the madman.</p>

<p>“‘I love my children,’ he cried, ‘but if the
Convention decrees war on the enemies of the
Republic, I will give my two daughters to the
first two of our countrymen wounded in
battle.’ Would he have said that seated
quietly at his fireside? Certainly not. It was
the mob that was talking through his mouth.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Terror</span></p>

<p>Mark returned to the subject on another
occasion. He said:</p>

<p>“You know I have always been a great
admirer of Dickens, and his ‘Tale of Two
Cities’ I read at least every two years. Dickens
witnessed my first holding hands with
Livy when I took her to one of his lectures in
New York. Now that I have finished ‘The
Two Cities’ for the ’steenth time, I have come
to this conclusion:</p>

<p>“Terror is an efficacious agent only when it
doesn’t last. In the long run there is more
terror in threats than in execution, for when
you get used to terror your emotions get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
dulled. The incarnation of the White Terror,
Robespierre, wasn’t awe-inspiring at all to the
general public. Mention of his name did not
send the children to bed, or make them crawl
under the blankets. On the days when he
made his great speeches, the galleries and the
aisles of the Convention Hall were thronged
with women, old and young—that does not
look as if Robespierre had been an object of
general fear or abomination—does it?”</p>

</div>


<p>“Now show me the place where that ancestor
of mine had King Charlie beheaded.”</p>

<p>We had been sitting on some chairs which
the great Napoleon had used in Saint Helena—the
heaviest sort of mahogany, “and not a rat
bite to be seen,” Mark pointed out, as we
went exploring the Army Museum at Whitehall,
London.</p>

<p>Agreeable to his demand, I took Mark by
the arm and led him to a window looking out
on the “Horse-Guards,” the famous old barracks,
gazed at so much by American visitors.</p>

<p>“Outside of this window,” I explained,
“the Commonwealth built a platform, and on
this platform stood the block where Charles
lost his silly bean.”</p>

<p>“Served the traitor right,” said Mark, “but
that reminds me of——”</p>

<p>He thought a while, then repeated:</p>

<p>“Why it reminds me of (let’s see, we are in
the second story, are we not?)—the grandstand
in front of the Palmer House, Chicago,
for that was also entered from the windows
of the second story. I am speaking of the
Chicago of 1879, welcoming General Grant
after his triumphal journey around the world.
What a sight the Windy City was, and what a
grand sight he looked when he stepped upon
the platform to review the Army of the Tennessee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I interrupted, “and I saw you on
that very platform shake hands with Grant.”</p>

<p>But Mark Twain could not be tempted to
go into his personal history when General
Grant was being discussed.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a city so magnificently
and so patriotically bedecked?” he cried.
“There was not a monument, palace, rookery,
saloon or telegraph pole that was not gay with
streamers and bunting, pictures, garlands,
colored lanterns and placards of all sorts.”</p>

<p>“Yes there was,” said one of our friends.</p>

<p>Mark stretched out his hand and grabbed
the speaker’s arm.</p>

<p>“No nonsense now.”</p>

<p>“I am as serious as you, and I say that the
German Consul, with offices opposite the
Court House, did not have a flag out on the
day of Grant’s entry and reception.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” demanded Clemens.</p>

<p>“As sure as you are standing there. And I
am proud to-day that I wrote up the story in
the Chicago ‘Times’ and that Guy Magee, the
city editor, headed it: ‘The German Son of
a B——.’</p>

<p>“Well done. I could not have written a
more accurate head myself.”</p>

<p>“Every time I went to Italy,” Mark Twain
once said, “I felt like crossing over into Monaco.”</p>

<p>“To gamble?”</p>

<p>“Guess again, when billiards and solitaire
are the only games I indulge in. Indeed, I am
so ignorant, I would not know a roulette from
another baby circus. I was and I am still
crazy to go to Monaco to see a gallows, or,
preferably, a hundred of them.” Mark eyed
his audience curiously. After an impressive
pause, he continued:</p>

<p>“Once upon a time, in the days of Louis XV
and Mme. du Barry, there was a Prince of
Monaco who was blessed with a very beautiful
wife. Well, evil-minded people said of this
prince that he smelled like a dead horse, and
Madame the Princess simply could not endure
defunct ‘gee-gee.’ So she decided that she
had a perfect right to look for a soul-mate
elsewhere, and be sure she got them by the
score. Of course not in Monaco, as it is such
a small country. She went to France, and
particularly to Paris, for her amusements.
And every time the Prince learned of a new
lover worshipping at his wife’s shrine, he set
up a gallows and hung the favored one in
effigy with frightful ceremonies.</p>

<p>“The country, as remarked, being rather
Lilliputian, his Highness had to go to the frontiers
for his gallows planting, and as Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
the Princess was of a very changeable nature
the principality, in the course of several years,
became enclosed in a regular fence of gallows
trees. When Paris heard of this, it laughed
boisterously at the Prince’s strange humor and
Madame the Princess’s latest lover swore that
he would go to Monaco, rob the gallows of
their manikins and carry them off to the future
Champs Elysées for a marionette show.</p>

<p>“He tried—with a band of companions, but
got pinched and was hanged by the neck in
person, and not in effigy. Now, I wondered
whether these gallows are still standing,”
concluded Mark, “and if not, I wanted to find
their habitat anyhow—make a map of gallows-land,
so to speak.”</p>

<p>Too bad Mark missed writing a book on so
promising a subject.</p>

<p>He read to several friends in Vienna what
he had written about the murdered Empress
Elizabeth. “I know it is full of exaggeration,”
he admitted. “I did gown her with virtues
she never thought of possessing and I have
denied all her frailties. As I learn now, she
was just an ordinary woman, and her surpassing
vanity was the only extraordinary
thing about her. But think how much she
suffered and think of the man she was married
to. Re-read, too, that story about the murdered
Rudolph. When Count Something approached
her to break the news, she ran to
him wringing her hands and cried: ‘My Rudy
is dead. Oh, my Rudy!’ What told this
Niobe among royal women that her son had
been destroyed—killed in a low debauch?
When I reflect how she maintained her self-respect
in a life of constant disappointment
and tragedy, I think I did well making her out
a noble soul.”</p>

<p>Returning to Vienna from a flying trip to
Budapest, Mark was full of “a yarn that would
illustrate like a circus and run for five years,
every Sunday a page.” He said he heard the
story at the archduke Joseph’s country place,
the same Joseph who, towards the end of the
war, tried to make himself King of Hungary
and failed, but the probabilities are that the
story was Mark’s own, with Magyar trimmings.
It ran as follows:</p>

<p>A great landowner, after a business trip
of several months, returned to Budapest, and
was met at the station by his carriage and
pair that was to take him to his estate in the
country.</p>

<p>“Everything well at home?” he asked the
coachman.</p>

<p>“Excellently well,” replied the driver,
cracking his whip.</p>

<p>After a while the Baron ventured another
question:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring my dogs along?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Dogs are sick, your Excellency.”</p>

<p>“My dogs sick? How did that happen?”</p>

<p>“Ate too much fried horse.”</p>

<p>“Fried horse? Where did they get that?”</p>

<p>“Stable burned down.”</p>

<p>“My stable burned down, cattle and all?
Awful! What about the castle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the castle is all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>The Baron thought it over for the space of
a mile, then said:</p>

<p>“You are sure the castle was not hurt by
the fire?”</p>

<p>“Sure, only the two wings burned down.”</p>

<p>“But the family is safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the family is all right.”</p>

<p>When the horses entered upon their tenth
mile, the Baron resumed his examination:</p>

<p>“Children all well?”</p>

<p>“All well and happy, except János and
Maritzka, who were burned.”</p>

<p>“Burned, oh Lord! And the Baroness,
my wife?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she is better off than any of us. God
has her in His holy keeping. She was burned
to death. Yes, indeed, she died with her
mother and in her arms.”</p>

<p>“This is what I call breaking the news
gently,” said Mark.</p>

from the throne of Brazil.</p>

<p>“Just as efficacious as if the car horses that
remain unbred since the arrival of the trolley

snapped Mark.</p>

<p>With Mark’s daughter Susie, I was walking
in the Berlin Thiergarten one afternoon when
we encountered a very rough specimen of the
genus tramp.</p>

<p>“Look at him,” said Susie. “You know,
Pa, too, was an awful man before Mamma took
him in hand and married him.” And with
added seriousness, she continued: “He used
to swear and swear, and then swear again, and
the only thing that he didn’t do that was bad
was to let cards and liquor alone—some kinds
of liquor.”</p>

<p>You know, of course, that Mark Twain at
one time had a flat in Berlin and kept it going
for a whole month. “I am tired of hotels,”
he said, “and hereafter I am going to take my
comfort in my apartment as Dr. Johnson took
his in his inn.” After that he entertained the
habitués of the embassy for a week or longer
with stories of the beauties of home life, until
we voted “Koernerstrasse Nr. 7 the jewel.”</p>

<p>But one fine evening I found a note from
him at the Hotel de Rome, asking me to call
at the Royal at 8:00. I met him in the lobby
with several sympathizing friends, and he said:</p>

<p>“It’s all up with Koernerstrasse; too much
police.”</p>

<p>“Did you have burglars, or the bailiffs, in?”
was asked.</p>

<p>“Neither; just social calls from policemen—ten
per day. The cops weren’t exactly unkind,
but they annoyed me.”</p>

<p>“What did they do to you?”</p>

<p>“Asked questions.”</p>

<p>“Income queries?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, but I don’t mind lying
about little things like that. On the contrary,
making a clean breast of it, I confessed that I
get a whole cent a word for every word I do,
even for little words like ‘I’ or ‘Manafraidofhismotherinlaw.’
Did they believe me? Not
they! They thought I was exaggerating.”</p>

<p>“What did they ask about next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Craved information about Eliza and
Marie. ‘Don’t know any such females,’ I
growled severely.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Clemens,’ bawled the policeman,
‘if you are trying to hoodwink the Royal
Police of Berlin, there will be trouble. Confess
now. You have an Eliza and a Marie and
a Gretchen in this house.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, you mean the maids,’ said I. ‘I
don’t know anything about them. My Missus
hires and bosses them. Ask the girls whether
I am stringing you.’</p>

<p>“That evidently made no hit with the
policeman, for he vociferated respectfully but
sternly:</p>

<p>“‘It is your duty (according to paragraph
this and that of the Civil Code) as head of the
household (according to paragraph so and so
of the Civil Code) to be informed whether or
not these girls have been properly vaccinated.’</p>

<p>“His ‘head of the household’ made me
laugh, but I managed to object: ‘How should
I know?’</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you see them around with bare
arms?’</p>

<p>“‘Maybe I do, but I never paid enough
attention to say offhand whether they wear
cuticle or fur.’</p>

<p>“‘And you didn’t notice vaccination marks
on their arms?’</p>

<p>“‘Never. I can swear to that.’</p>

<p>“‘Then you <i>do</i> know, that they are not
vaccinated on their arms,’ said the policeman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
ever so insinuatingly. I’ll bet he read
up the story of the serpent in Paradise.</p>

<p>“‘On the contrary, I <i>don’t</i> know whether
they are vaccinated on their arms or not,’
I answered truthfully. ‘Maybe they had
themselves vaccinated <i>under</i> their arms. I
haven’t looked.’</p>

<p>“‘Some women,’ said the policeman, ‘are
so vain that they get themselves vaccinated
on their legs.’</p>

<p>“‘Possibly,’ I said, ‘but I have looked
neither under their arms nor under their
petticoats—I presume they have legs. However,
I don’t know anything about them, for
sure. And this being their day out, if you
<i>must</i> investigate, they will be back about
ten o’clock, and, returning, you may look
for yourself, if the law says so.’”</p>

<p>Mark indulged in one of his impressive
pauses, then continued:</p>

<p>“That policeman did return and told the
girls that he was authorized by me to look
for their vaccination marks wherever located.
Of course, it caused a row all around, the
girls protesting that I was no gentleman. So,
to end it all, I paid the rent for the whole
year, eleven months’ rent, and left the flat.”</p>

<p>James R. Osgood, the former Boston publisher,
later a member of the new firm of
Osgood, McIlvain &amp; Company in London,
for whom I was doing the translation of
Field Marshal Count Moltke’s works, had
given me a set of Memoirs of the Margravine
of Bayreuth for Christmas, and when I went
to see Mark Twain at the Royal in Berlin
during his illness, I took the two small
volumes along and offered to loan them to
the sick man. He was as pleased as a three-year-old
with a new toy.</p>

<p>“I always wanted to read these Memoirs,”
he said. “She was a corker, that sister of
the Great Frederick. I most heartily admire
her. You know Howells did this translation
while U. S. Consul in Italy and they say it
is the best ever.” He dived into volume one
and I left, to return next day. When he
heard me talk in the vestibule to Mrs.
Clemens, he hollered out:</p>

<p>“This way to the sausage room, where Her
Royal Highness’ slave keeps.”</p>

<p>I went in.</p>

<p>“I am reading this book for the second
time,” he said, “and it actually makes me
forget that I am sick. I forget even coughing
my soul out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Clemens seemed to be annoyed about
the “sausage,” but Clemens said that Heine
had had the same sort of chamber when ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
so long, and as the poet was quite contented
“with his French Soucisson,” he must be with
his “Frankfurter.” As a matter of fact, for
its length, the room was extremely narrow.</p>

<p>“If it had legs, I would call it a <i>dachshund</i>,”
suggested Mark, when Livy kept on grumbling.</p>

<p>I asked whether he had many visitors and
he said:</p>

<p>“Yes, a few every day. As many as I can
stand. But the women have all deserted me.
There is a bunch of American girls in Berlin
just now, but none find their way to the
Royal. I am without a “<i>Mouche</i>” (French
for fly)—I mean the human kind—the same
as enlivened Heine’s dying days. What a
girl that <i>Mouche</i> was! I think she inspired
some of his finest shorter poems. She was a
real comfort to him, too. Maybe she was
after advertising and liked to make Mathilda
jealous. But, what of it? She made Heine
laugh and Heine’s songs will make the world
happier as long as it stands.”</p>

<p>While talking, he was groping in the air
after flies and at last caught one. He held
it in the hollow of his hand listening to its
buzzing for a while, then asked me to take it
in my own hand, never hurt it, open the
window and let it fly out.</p>

<p>“I learned that from Tolstoy,” he said.
“Tolstoy, you know, used to catch lots of
mice in his house, but never killed them or
gave them to the cat. He carried them out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to the forest and there set them free. Why
should a human being kill little animals?
Because a tiger may want to eat me—that’s
no reason why I should turn tiger, is it?”</p>

<p>He returned to the subject of the Margravine
Wilhelmina.</p>

<p>“They thought I went to Bayreuth to hear
Wagner,” he said. “Nothing of the kind. I
like his Wedding March hugely and very little
else he has done. But, while Livy and the
kids went to pieces over Tristan und Isolde
and The Nibelungen, I visited the grave of
the Margravine and looked at the temples
and grottoes and houses she built, the statues
and fountains she set up, the beauty she
lavished on the landscape! Ah, Wilhelmina
would have been the woman for me—for a
week or two, I mean, even as I would like
to have been the Great Frederick’s dinner
companion for a little while.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARKS_GLIMPSE_OF">MARK’S GLIMPSE OF
SCHOPENHAUER</h2>
</div>


<p>As Mark’s German was getting worse
instead of better, and as his French was nowhere,
he asked me to accompany him on
his contemplated exploration of the Berlin
Royal Library. I told the librarian about
our great friend, about the interest he took
in German affairs, and, in particular, I recalled
that he had met the Kaiser at dinner.
Of course the librarian turned himself inside
out to be agreeable to both of us.</p>

<p>After showing us around a good deal, he
gave us an alcove to work in, saying: “In
this set of drawers you will find some most
private papers of the royal family that are
perhaps of public interest, but the public,
please remember, must learn nothing of them.
They are only to be seen by people of discretion,
who value historical knowledge for
history’s sake.”</p>

<p>Most of the books, pamphlets and manuscripts
we found dated from the times of
Frederick the Great and of course they were
in French, since Frederick neither read nor
wrote German intelligently. There was in
particular a volume of verse by Voltaire
addressed to Frederick, with original illustrations
by some French artist, but the poetry
was too grossly indecent to have interest for
persons outside of a psychopathic ward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>I translated some of the verses to Mark,
who said: “Too much is enough. I would
blush to remember any of these stanzas
except to tell Krafft-Ebing about them when
I get to Vienna.”</p>

<p>I copied one verse for him, and as he put
it in his pocket he said:</p>

<p>“Livy is so busy mispronouncing German
these days she can’t even attempt to get at
this.”</p>

<p>After some rummaging, Mark pulled out a
manuscript that seemed to be of more recent
date.</p>

<p>“German or Chinese laundry tickets?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s German,” I said, glancing at it.</p>

<p>There were about ten pages of copy, neatly
written and headed “Mein Briefkasten” (My
letterbox). On the line below was the title:
“Tetragamy by Schopenhauer.”</p>

<p>Mark was at once interested.</p>

<p>“Schopenhauer, the arch-misogynist,” he
mused, “let me see, physically he might have
been the grandfather of queer Strindberg of
the land where the matches come from. Ever
read any of his books or dramas?” he asked,
and before I could deny the implication, he
was off talking again: “I have studied
Strindberg’s womankind, hard-faced, sullen,
cold-blooded, cheeky, grasping, vindictive,
hell-raising, unvirtuous, unkind vixens, all of
them—a dead give-away on the author’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
part, for a writer who sees no good in women
confesses that he was found out by the sex
he wars on and that the female of the species
pronounced him n. g. before he had time to
out-Ibsen the Norwegian. If I ever turn over
a new leaf and beat Livy, bet your life I will
have naught but honeyed words and sweet
metaphor for the ladies. This fellow Strindberg’s
women are all compounds of vile
ingredients—hideous hags with or without
angel-faces—wife-beater Strindberg whipping
dead mares. Well, to return to Schopenhauer
(to me as incomprehensible as mutton) what’s
this?” (pointing to the word Tetragamy),
“Hebrew or merely Yiddish?”</p>

<p>“Literally it means marrying a fourth
wife.” I examined the first page of the manuscript.
“Seems to deal with conditions due
to monogamy.”</p>

<p>“Good,” exclaimed Mark, “I have always
wanted to reform monogamy, when my wife
isn’t looking. Now let’s have the medicine
straight.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “I can’t do this long MS.
justice here. The librarian will come in
presently and you heard what he told us.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mark, “you sit down and
copy the German while I cover you with
my broad back. Should the librarian intrude,
I will knock on the floor.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, I copied those several pages, and
afterwards made the translation Mark wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>But for several days Mark didn’t show up
at his usual haunts, and even Mr. Phelps,
the American Minister in Berlin, didn’t know
what had become of him. The telephone
was but sparingly used then in the legation
offices. However, on the third or fourth day,
Mr. Phelps learned that Mark was down
with bronchitis at his hotel, the Royal, and
that when he wasn’t sneezing or coughing,
<i>ennui</i> plagued him sadly.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I have got something to
liven him up,” and showed Mr. Phelps the
manuscript. He advised me to send it at
once to the Royal, but when I called on Mark
Twain a week later and inquired <i>sotto voce</i>
whether he had received the manuscript, he
said:</p>

<p>“Of course not. The wife got it and you
know she won’t let me read anything but
tracts. I suppose she burnt our MS.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I have got a carbon and
I will let you have that by and by.”</p>

<p>“Not while I’m at home,” he said, “for
now she is on the scent, she will watch out.
She is dreadfully afraid that some one may
corrupt me.”</p>

<p>Mark remained indoors for over a month,
the thing was forgotten, and later, when he
asked for the manuscript, I couldn’t find it.
Other interests came up and Schopenhauer
was shelved, though at the time we made the
find, Mark speculated on getting a book out
of it by amplifying it with other writings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the philosopher, particularly his “Fragments
of Philosophy” and his “Pandectes et Spicilegia”;
the latter are still in manuscript or,
at least, were in manuscript in the early
nineties.</p>

<p>If Mark were alive to-day, how happy he
would be at the discovery I made quite
recently in an old chest of drawers. I had
seen a movie play, showing the extravagant
amounts of money one can earn by selling
old manuscripts—including the rejection slips—and
I started cleaning up an old piece of
furniture wanted for less ideal purposes. And
there I found the long lost Schopenhauer
MS. According to the notes, this manuscript
belonged to a parcel of handwritten
essays willed by the philosopher to the Royal
Library at Berlin and dealing with themes
and matters that Schopenhauer hoped to
work out and improve upon by and by.
But death overtook him before he could
exploit the problem in hand. Here follows
the MS. Mark was not allowed to see:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><i>Schopenhauer’s Tetragamy.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>The Philosopher’s Attempt to reform social
conditions due to Monogamy.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Neither woman’s frailty nor man’s egoism
should be held responsible for those
frequent miscarriages of domestic happiness
encountered in married life. Nature itself
is to blame. If the state of monogamy, as
some of the philosophers will have it, is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
natural one, then nature disarranged its own
scheme beforehand by making woman’s sexual
life twenty or thirty or even forty years
shorter than man’s.</p>

<p>At the present time males and females in
the civilized world are about equal in number.
This, too, is taken for proof that nature
favored monogamy. It is a fact, on the other
hand, observable in practical life as well as
by medical investigation, that a woman is
well able physically to be the wife of two men
at the same time.</p>

<p>There are no healthier and more beautiful
women, of their kind, than the Tedas of Asia
who marry besides their chief-husband all
his brothers, no matter how many he has got.</p>

<p>We do not go so far as to advocate polyandry.
Polyandry is a condition based on a
low state of civilization. But basing our
proposition on physical grounds, we venture
to assert that tetragamy, reorganized and
protected by law, would be a married state
doing away with most of the evils of monogamy
from the man’s standpoint, while contributing
to woman’s happiness.</p>

<p>We propose the introduction of a new form
of marriage on the following lines. Instead
of one man marrying one woman for better
or worse, we propose that two men, friends
of course, marry one woman, always a young
and healthy person, with this understanding:</p>

<p>After the woman has reached a certain
age, the two friends shall be at liberty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
marry another young woman, but without
divorcing or abandoning the first.</p>

<p>The second woman shall provide the men,
if she lives, with a capable and loving mate
for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>Such a state of things would result in the
happiness of two women, both would be
taken care of for life and there would be no
rivalry either.</p>

<p>As far as the men are concerned, tetragamy
would do away with a passion leading
to so many fatalities: jealousy.</p>

<p>Now let us look at tetragamy, as defined,
from an economic standpoint.</p>

<p>At the present time, the average young
couple enters into the marriage state when
the man’s capacity as a provider is unequal
to the demands of the average pleasure-loving
woman. His meagre resources do not allow
him to supply her with the luxuries she
craves, nor has he as much money for himself
as before marriage. It would be a waste of
words to point out that these conditions are
responsible for much unhappiness among
married folks.</p>

<p>Take a case of poverty. Many a man who
can hardly support himself tries to support
a wife, and not only a wife, but children,
numbers of them! What is the result? The
woman, driven by want, for the love of her
children, becomes a breadwinner on her own
account. The time she ought to devote to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
her little ones, born or unborn, she spends
in the factory, at the washboard or sewing
machine.</p>

<p>Is that natural? If nature favored such
a state of affairs, nature would be illogical,
and who dare assert so monstrous a thing?</p>

<p>In the state of tetragamy, man has to bear
but one-half of the household’s expenses.
This gives him a chance to save money and
to do something for his education, while the
children, being supported by two men, have
better clothes, better food, more love, and a
better home.</p>

<p>Tetragamy would make for morality, because
it would make it easier for men to get
married. It would make for morality because
woman, having two husbands, would not be
longing for an affinity. And when old, she
would not suffer from the thought, or from
the actual knowledge, that her husband
betrays her.</p>

<p>Things are different to-day. The man who
marries young sees the fire of love extinguished
in the woman at his side after a
certain number of years.</p>

<p>As to the average woman, in the state of
monogamy, she is only too often compelled
to marry a man physically inferior to her.
If she escapes that fate, then, in the course
of time, she must needs come to the conclusion
that she is too old for her husband.</p>

<p>But I am not unaware that there are serious
objections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>As to the children, their identity would be
determined by their looks.</p>

<p>As to possible differences—they will not
be greater than in marriage as it is to-day.
If people are inclined to fight, they will do so
under any conditions, good, bad or indifferent.
For my own part I am inclined to
think that there will be less fighting, since
jealousy will be eliminated beforehand.</p>

<p>What about financial affairs? There should
be no communism, of course. Each man
could contribute his share and the woman
should be allowed free disposal of her savings.</p>

<p>Of course, the state must take the first
woman under its protection. She can never
be abandoned and can be divorced for cause
only.</p>

<p>Under the sway of monogamy duties and
nature are forever in conflict. Woman is
tempted when young, is abandoned morally
or physically or both when old.</p>

<p>If this be natural, then nature should be
reformed and tetragamy substituted for monogamy.</p>

OXFORD</h2>
</div>


<p>“Oxford, though you might not think so,
has a traffic cop, the same as Forty-Second
Street and Fifth Avenue,” said Mark in the
Savoy Lounge across the teacups after the
excitement over his triumph in the British
University metropolis had cooled down a bit.
“He is a smart guy—actually remembers
Holmes’ visit and asked me about the old
man. He spoke of him as ‘Ome’s, Sweet
Ome’s.’ When you come to think of it, it’s
a good name, after all.</p>

<p>“Among other interesting things, not connected
with the University, was a public
house sign I lit upon at a corner not far from
our inn. It showed a great warrior on a
fierce charger. ‘General Blucher’ was written
across the bottom. It gave me quite a start
when I learned that on this spot, in 1816 or
1817, Blucher hollered for a drink and got it
when on his way to the University.”</p>

<p>“What did he want with the University?”
I queried.</p>

<p>“He was crowned a doctor there after
Waterloo.</p>

<p>“I tell you, that took me down a peg, or
rather a whole row of pegs. Blucher a doctor
like myself! I knew him as a foul-mouthed,
cruel, pestiferous, and thieving scoundrel—occasionally
lucky in the field. But now I
wanted to know more about him and I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
haunted the British Museum for additional
facts. What do you think I learned? Blucher,
who was dirty and slouchy by nature, dressed
up on the eve of battle:—best tunic, fancy
sword, gilt lace, feathered hat and what-not!
And he had himself bathed, rouged and
powdered, manicured and curry-combed.</p>

<p>“‘I feel like a girl going to her first ball,’
he used to say.</p>

<p>“And people like that, who delight in
murder and rapine, receive honorary degrees!”</p>

<p>Susan, Jean, and Clara Clemens, papa
Mark, and myself were having lots of fun at
the famous Salamonski Circus in Berlin—Mark
and I laughing with the children when
there was nothing else to interest us. There
was a girl of 16 or 17 doing a stunt on a horse.
Mark said: “The poor child looks as if she
had never had a square meal in her life—isn’t
that professional smile of hers too sad
for words?” While she was doing a salto
mortale, a clown ran in and dived between
the horse’s legs. The horse got frightened
and threw the rider. Of course, the children
thought this part of the program, and laughed
heartily. But the girl didn’t attempt to get
up, and when the riding master tried to raise
her, she cried and moaned, and one of her legs
hung down lifeless, while the blood spurted
through her white tights.</p>

<p>“Keep still, children,” said Mark. “Don’t
you see the poor girl is hurt?”</p>

<p>A stretcher came and carried off the moaning
girl and the performance proceeded as if
nothing had happened. But though the
children begged hard, Mark would not stay.</p>

<p>“Another time, not now,” he insisted.</p>

<p>Just then a gypsy-looking, elderly woman
came running from behind the scenes, looking
about wildly. When her eye located the
clown, she rushed up to him and hit him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
terrible blow in the face. “You have ruined
my girl. She will never be able to ride
again,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Served him right,” said Mark. “I do hope
the manager gets a clout on the jaw, too.
For he really is the responsible guy. The
clown has to get laughs, the girl has to risk
her limbs, so that the manager may coin
money. What a world this is, what a world!
And you and I, too! I never thought of
kicking myself for laughing when that poor
girl broke her leg—nor did you, I bet.”</p>

<p>At the time when Mark was living quietly
at Ledworth Square, London, writing “Around
the World,” we met a party of Australians at
the Metropole one afternoon. It was after
poor Susie’s death, and the heartbroken father
hadn’t made anyone laugh for months. But
those “Aussies kind of woke me up,” he
admitted. “Jolly guys, out there at the Antipodes,”
he said after the first round; “too
bad I didn’t know that when I struck Sydney.
As I prepared to step upon the platform
there, I wondered, with some fear and trepidation,
whether your people would take kindly
to my brand of humor. If they refused to be
tickled by my first lecture—God have mercy
upon my creditors! Of course I had my story
pat. Still, as I climbed those steps, I debated
in my mind whether or not I had better substitute
such or such a yarn for the opening
lines planned. I had half decided to risk a
change, when I faced the audience and—the
pleasantest, the most overwhelming surprise
of my life! I met a sea, a whole Atlantic, of
guffawing heads, of swaying bodies and shoulders.
There wasn’t a titter or a snicker;
there wasn’t any smirking or grinning; all
eyes were in flood with genuine laughter;
men, women, and children were crowing and
chuckling aloud, were shouting and hurraying,
everybody was convulsed—really I must
have looked the white kangaroo for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>

at me before I opened my mouth clinched
my success at the Antipodes.”</p>

<p>From Paris Mark Twain usually returned
disgruntled. His stories did not go in France,
and there was that “Dreyfus affair” that
made him sick of the “frog-eaters forever and
a day.” Nor was Mark appreciated in Italy.</p>

<p>“The Dagoes,” he used to say, “like their
humor colored with politics, of which I know
nothing, or flavored with risqué stories, which
my wife won’t let me write—there you are.
As to France—one critical Madame gave me
to understand that I am ‘lacking in the stupendous
task of interpreting the great tableaux
of real American life.’ See? When a
wet blanket of that kind is clapped on to you,
what is the use of further efforts? I am a
dead one, according to Madame, and Mark
Twain is too humane to whip a dead horse.
I will tell you what is really the matter with
France,” concluded Twain. “Every Frenchman
who can read and write has in his closet
a frock coat embroidered with the lilies (or
whatever flower it may be) of the <i>Académie
Française</i>—hoping against hope that he may
be elected to the Institute like Molière or
Zola. Hence Monsieur is very critical and
pronounces everything he doesn’t understand
‘bosh!’ A joke in Chicago, you know, is
a riddle in Paris, and, as one Frenchman put
it, ‘I get guffaws out of people by thumping
them on the ribs.’ I would never dare thump
a Frenchman, of course—I might bust him.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHY_MARK_WOULDNT_LIKE_TO_DIE">WHY MARK WOULDN’T LIKE TO DIE
ABROAD</h2>
</div>


<p>Mark Twain cracked so many jokes, I
thought I would entertain him a bit myself,
and told him about an aunt of mine who,
while dying, heard that she was going to lie
in state in the green room.</p>

<p>“Not in the green room,” said auntie. “I
always hated that wall paper. Besides, it’s
unhealthy.”</p>

<p>Twain admitted that was good fun, and
regretted not having thought of the green
paper himself.</p>

<p>“She must have been a fine old girl,” he
said, “to stand up for her rights even ‘in
extremis,’ as the doctors call it.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” he continued, “every time I
paddle the Atlantic I say to myself, ‘Mark, old
boy, don’t die on this trip.’ For, of course,
folks have a foolish notion that one’s bones
must rest at home. Accordingly, if I died as
United States consul in the Kingdom of Sheba—if
there be such a place—Washington would
have to send a warship to fetch my bones
back to America. Again, if I died a plain
citizen in London, I would be shipped back in
an ordinary liner. But think of it. Before
shipping my body, it would have to go into
an undertaker’s vault, and undertakers’ cellars
are dark and mildewed, and nasty smelling.
By George, I wouldn’t like to be in a cellar for
a week or two. And afterwards they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
place the casket in the hold of the ship with
other boxes, and the rats come gnawing about,
and perhaps the ocean looks in too and gives
you a swim. No, it isn’t pleasant to die
abroad. I want to die at home, in bed and in
comfort.”</p>

<p>At another time Mark returned to the
theme, saying:</p>

<p>“Remember my story about the body in the
morgue? They couldn’t make out whether the
person was dead or merely shamming death,
and so they put a bell-rope in the man’s hand,
and later, when the man awoke from his
deathlike sleep and rang the bell, the watchers
got so frightened they ran away, and, it being
freezing cold, the man died a real death. When
they next looked upon him, he was as dead as
a doornail. No, as I said before, I want to die
at home, without any bell-ropes, or undertakers’
cellars, or rats, or bilge water.”</p>

<p>“I saw your protégé in Paris—he is getting

meeting him in the Strand, London.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean by protégé,”
he said evasively, “but I am glad to hear that
the boy is progressing. Do you know,” he
added quickly, “I hold with that famous
English letter-writer, whose name I forget,
that an artist has brush and pencil and that
the public will reward him as it sees fit.”</p>

<p>Of course, Mark didn’t “hold” anything of
the sort. He had then supported that bright
American boy in Paris for three years, giving
him the best of teachers and advancing his
chances in every way possible, but he resented
my touching upon the subject. I suppose he
would have cut me dead the next time we met,
if I had reminded him of the colored boy whom
he was seeing through college in the States.</p>

Jackson’s office. Jackson was the first secretary

was asked for his opinion.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “the greatest American
humorist I know of is Mr. Fox of the ‘Police

<p>In the nineties Mark had asked me to
translate his yarn on telepathy for the “Berlin
Boersen Courier.” The story had caught on,
and the editor kept bothering for more of that
sort. Mark had promised again and again,
but nothing came of it. When I asked him for
the tenth or fifteenth time, he said, “Pshaw,
telepathy is out of date. I saw some mental
suggestion done at Professor Glossen’s in
Zurich that knocked spots out of telepathy.”
He asked the rest of the company to listen,
and continued:</p>

<p>“That there be no room for deception of
any kind, the professor asked me to go to any
drug store in town and buy a bottle of distilled
water. We scraped the label off, swathed the
bottle in linen, and then buried it carefully in
a box—a sort of fireless cooker arrangement.
This was done before the students began to
arrive. When the lecture room was good and
full, the Professor addressed the boys to the
effect that he was on the track of a new chemical,
but that his discovery was still far from
complete. The chemical, he continued, had a
peculiar odor, heretofore not classified, and
this morning he was anxious to study the rapidity
with which that odor would diffuse itself
through the air. Hence he asked the students
to give the utmost attention to what he was
doing. Each student was to raise his hand
the moment he perceived the strange odor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“The Professor unburied and opened the
bottle, turning his head away so as not to be
overcome by the odor, while I watched the
proceedings by a stop-watch. The boys were
all ears—nose, I mean. After fifteen seconds,
most of the students in the first row were holding
up a hand. In 40 seconds the odor, which
did not exist, had traveled to the rear benches,
and when we counted noses, seventy-five percent
of the students acknowledged perception
of the odor and some even went so far as to be
nauseated by it.”</p>

<p>At Brown’s, in London, somebody spoke in
glowing terms of Raymond’s portrayal of
Colonel Sellers.</p>

<p>“You needn’t praise him for <i>my</i> sake,” said
Mark. “I did not write the part for an actor
like him at all. I wrote it for Edwin Booth.
That is, I had Edwin Booth in mind when I
did the play. But Raymond was the superior
money-maker. He had the masses with him—and
I was pressed for funds.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, my Colonel Sellers is
a portrait study—a take-off on a fine old
Southern gentleman, Colonel Mulberry Sellers,
whom I knew in life. He had some funny
traits about him, but these never counted with
me. It was the pathos in his life that got me.
And the pathos, relieved by a few funny
things, I intended to put upon the stage.
Raymond caricatured the part, and I often
felt like taking it away from him.”</p>

<p>He was reminded of his visit to the Berlin

<p>“They were so loaded down with tiaras,
necklaces, and sets of jewelry, my eyes were
too dazzled to get a good view of their faces.
I am sure, though, that most of the old ones
had enormous backs. And that recalls a story
that I heard at an embassy here, which I must
not name. The ambassadors were talking of
the beauty of the women of their own country,
and they all looked with pity on the Korean
consular representative, wondering what he
would say, but he was a spunky chap, and
when his turn came, blurted out: ‘Well, gentlemen,
as to the fair sex, there isn’t much to
boast of in my country, but I <i>will</i> admit that
the ladies of our court at home are no less ill-favored
than the women of the Berlin Schloss,
and they are dirtier, too.’ That postscript,”
said Mark, “was the funniest thing I heard in
a long time. He said it in a right hearty and
well-meaning way, too. He evidently meant
it and was proud of it.”</p>

<p>I congratulated Mark Twain on the fact
that he had been mistaken for the great
Mommsen, and, throwing out his chest, he
said:</p>

<p>“I feel indeed flattered because somebody
thought that I have the whole Roman world,
with Poppæa and Nero and Augustus and all
the rest, under my hat, yet, when I come to
think of it, there is some difference between
us two. <i>My</i> children know their papa, and I
know Susan, Clara, and Jean. But think what
happened to Mommsen the other day. He
was proceeding to a bus from his residence,
when an unmannerly wind carried off his hat.
A boy, playing in the street, picked it up and
brought it to the great man. (By the way,
never run after your own hat—others will be
delighted to do it. Why spoil their fun?)</p>

<p>“‘Thank you,’ said Mommsen. ‘I never
could have recovered the hat myself.’ He
looked the boy over carefully, and added:</p>

<p>“‘And a nice little boy. Do you live in the
neighborhood? Whose little boy are you?’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ said the kid, ‘mamma says I am
Professor Mommsen’s little boy, but I never
see him. He is always among the Romans,
writing in a book.’</p>

<p>“‘Bless your heart, little man,’ said
Mommsen. ‘To-night I will surely be home
early; tell your mamma, and ask her to introduce
you and the other children properly.’”</p>

<p>Mark never tired telling of the Italian literary
shark who unsuccessfully tried to blackmail
him out of twenty francs.</p>

<p>“He had a peculiar grievance, that Dago,”
said Mark. “He vocalized to the effect
that he had done me the honor to call four
times at my villa and that, just as often, he
came near losing the seat of his pants by the
actions of my degraded dogs, who drove him off.
Hence, he calculated that I owed him at least
five francs per visit, on account of his trouble
and the anxiety he suffered. But as I kept no
dogs, neither degraded nor otherwise, my dogs
couldn’t have worried the man. And he
wasn’t on my visiting list anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere,” continued Mark, “I put on
record that I know the business end of a horse
very well, but I never bothered enough about
dogs to make sure of their anatomy. Pussy
is the animal for me. You remember my
adventures in Koernerstrasse No. 7, Berlin.
The women took that apartment in Slumland
over my head, and lured me to approve of
their choice by having two purring cats on the
hearth, when I first saw the place. I simply
can’t resist a cat, particularly a purring one.
They are the cleanest, cunningest, and most
intelligent things I know, outside of the girl
you love, of course.”</p>

<p>On October 13, 1891, Mark Twain and I
went together to the Berlin University to see
the great Virchow lionized and almost deified
by his fellow professors and by the students.
Mark was much impressed and promised to
give Virchow a good send-off in his correspondence.
And on the way home he waxed
almost sentimental, saying: “Virchow is
seventy years old. In a little while he will
either be dead or that great intellect of his
will begin to deteriorate, and what a pity that
would be!</p>

<p>“There was Emerson, who valued impressions
and ideas above everything—in his way
as great a man as Virchow and certainly a
great benefactor of his countrymen. But
Holmes told me that in the late seventies of
his long life, facts counted no longer with
Emerson, for his memory was gone. At Longfellow’s
funeral, which preceded his own by a
few months only, Emerson walked up to the
coffin twice, probably forgetting the second
time that he had already gazed upon his late
friend’s face. When he had taken this last
farewell, he came back to his seat and said
to the person nearest to him:</p>

<p>“‘That dead man was a sweet and beautiful
soul, but I have completely forgotten his
name.’</p>

<p>“For myself,” concluded Twain, “I have
forgotten many a thing, but I will never forget<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
that little speech of poor old Emerson. <i>Sic
transit gloria mundi</i>—such is the way of the
world, a free translation, I know, but highly
applicable.”</p>

<p>“I heard a good one on a young Scotchman,
a fellow who was always trying to show off in
kilties. By the way, Andy Carnegie told me
about him. This young Scot, with some other
chaps, went on a tramp of the lakes of Scotland,
and young Douglas had a good time
showing off his fine calves—talked about them
and made comparisons with other well-known
legs, of actresses, bishops, dancers, etc. (In
England all bishops wear knickers, you know.)</p>

<p>“At night the boys put up at a rather dilapidated
inn, neither clean nor promising other
creature comforts. But the girl who waited
on them, maid or scullion, was a dandy—blonde
and blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked and sturdy
of arm and leg.</p>

<p>“As she flitted in and out of the room,
bringing whiskey and water, cheese, bread and
dried fish—that was all the bill of fare afforded—the
travelers’ eyes followed her, and when
she left the room there was many a knowing
wink. Douglas got jealous of the attention
bestowed on Miriam.</p>

<p>“‘What is there to go daft over?’ he demanded
peevishly.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said they in chorus, ‘for one thing,
she has better legs than you, Douglas.’</p>

<p>“Douglas hotly denied the imputation. There
was an argument, and it was finally agreed
that the two be measured. If Douglas lost,
he must pay for the night’s reckoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Accordingly, Douglas was put to the tape,
and the girl also. Miriam had a few more
inches of calf, but the Scotchman was undaunted.
‘Have you ever seen finer thighs
than mine?’ he boasted.</p>

<p>“The lad who had been doing the measuring
got flustered, but the girl laughed:</p>

<p>“‘Don’t be afeerd, Laddie; the higher you
go the bigger they grow. I’ll be the winner.’</p>

<p>“And she was,” said Mark, with a chuckle

<p>From a window at the Hotel de Rome,
Mark and friends were “reviewing” the
ceremonial entry of the King of Italy in Berlin.</p>

<p>“Fine horse-flesh,” Mark kept saying, “and
the gee-gees look better fed and happier than
all that bedizened and beribboned royalty.”</p>

<p>“What’s that string of riders following the
‘four-poster’” (Mark’s description of a state
coach), “tied to the twelve horses? They
seem to sport every conceivable uniform,
Horse, Foot, and Artillery!”</p>

<p>“Those are the German kings and kinglets,”
it was explained.</p>

<p>“Let’s count them,” said Mark.</p>

<p>They counted some twenty crowned heads,
“young, old, and mouse-colored,” said our
friend, as he retired from the window and
attacked the coffee and cake. He sat musing
for a while, but when somebody suggested
“billiards,” he became alert as usual.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” he said—“thinking
of wise Providence. Just fancy that Providence
had run the Equator through Europe,
instead of through the Pacific, or wherever it
is now. If the Equator happened to be located
in the Old World, each of the kings we have
seen, and more to be heard from, would be
itching and grabbing for it, pouring out their
subjects’ blood like water (saving their own,
of course) to get hold of the blamed thing.
I would make them <i>sit</i> on it. Hot dogs.”</p>

<p>In the Berlin of 1891, street-car conductors
gave you a ticket for every mile traveled,
and you were expected to keep all these tickets
or slips of paper in apple-pie order to show to an
inspector who might, or might not, come
around. Mark regularly threw his on the
floor, and dropped cigar ashes on them.
Accordingly, he had to pay double fare every
little while, and was abused into the bargain.</p>

<p>One afternoon, going to the Legation, we
got into an old, rather narrow bus, and opposite
Mark sat a woman with an enormous
bosom.</p>

<p>“What do you bet she takes No. 52. corsets?”
he whispered. “She grew that as a shelf
for her bus tickets,” he continued. “If I had
a ‘chester’ like that, I could save money.”</p>

<p>After a pause, he turned suddenly on me:</p>

<p>“What is bust in German?”</p>

<p>“Busen,” I translated.</p>

<p>“Male, female, or neuter?”</p>

<p>“Male—der Busen.”</p>

<p>He began slapping his knees with both
hands, waggled his head from one side to the
other, and laughed till the tears ran down his
cheeks. But he never said another word on
that trip.</p>

<p>Two months later the lecture, “The Awful
German Tongue,” was delivered. But at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>

genitive case, declinations, definite and indefinite

<p>Mr. Clemens had met Lenbach, the eminent
German painter, in Vienna, and when, a year
or two afterwards, I ran across Mark in
Munich, he proposed that we call at Lenbach’s
studio. So to Akademie Strasse we went, and
duly admired Lenbach’s collections. “Mostly
painted kaisers, kings, and kinglets, also one
man, W. K. Vanderbilt,” was Mark’s estimate.
I saw Lenbach eye Clemens with business
in his heart. Mark saw it too. “Wonder
if he intends to throw me on the linen, I mean
the canvas,” he whispered, while Lenbach
was busy in another part of the shop.</p>

<p>“It would increase his popularity immensely,”
I sotto voce’ed back.</p>

<p>Lenbach returned—with a camera, and as
Mark looked puzzled, Lenbach explained:
“I always get every possible angle I can of the
persons I want to paint. Now, if you will
just stand still, Mr. Clemens, for a little while,
I will be ever so much obliged.”</p>

<p>And Lenbach made the rounds of Clemens,
who had taken off his overcoat, more than
once, photographing every important bit of
anatomy, back, sides, front, arms, legs, ear,
full face, back of head, cheeks, hands, eyes,
etc.</p>

<p>“They told me in Vienna that Lenbach was
an artist,” commented Mark when we gained
the sidewalk. “As you saw, he is merely a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
photographer. Glad I never went to pieces
over his art with a capital A.”</p>

<p>Whether the painting was ever undertaken
by Lenbach I don’t know, but it would be
immensely interesting to get those plates from
the “photographer’s” studio.</p>

ABOUT HARRY THAW</h2>
</div>


<p>During his last visit to London, Mark called
me up one morning and said: “My arm aches
and I can’t do it myself, so for God’s sake,
take me to a barber who can scrape one’s face
without taking half the hide off. I am getting
mighty tired of being flayed alive in this here
burg.”</p>

<p>Accordingly we drove down to the Cecil in
the Strand.</p>

<p>“I understand you are the man who treats
a delicate skin like an American beauty rose,”
said Mark to the barber.</p>

<p>“I will treat yours, Mr. Clemens, as if it
were a butterfly. For I have read what you
have said about Italian barbers,” was answered.
And the things that happened to
Mark’s face, head, hands and feet while in the
chair would fill a column of “The Times” to
enumerate. He remained two hours in the
chair, and was not allowed to pay a red penny
for the accommodation.</p>

<p>Later, at a well-known grillroom, we saw
the massage artist alone at a table, and seated
ourselves at the same board. The barber
talked about other American celebrities and
notorieties he had treated and mentioned
Thaw.</p>

<p>“Oh, you shaved Harry—tell me about it,”
said Mark.</p>

<p>When the barber had finished, Mark insisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
looking fiercely at me: “Not a word
of this in New York, or there will be another
dozen Thaw trials.”</p>

<p>As Harry Thaw is now disposed of, temporarily,
at least, it won’t do any harm to print
Mark’s interview with the barber.</p>

<p>It seems that Harry and Evelyn occupied
a suite at the Cecil before they made that
notorious exhibition of themselves in New
York. Harry was an early riser and Evelyn
was not, and when the barber called at eight,
as ordered, Evelyn either had to be put out of
bed forcibly by Harry or remained under the
covers (for a time at least).</p>

<p>“And could you do your barbering and
currycombing with that pretty thing within
arm’s length?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“I had to,” said the barber. “I was paid
for it; besides, there was a terrible horsewhip
on the bed and a revolver in an open drawer.</p>

<p>“Harry insisted upon smoking while I
wielded the razor, and I had the greatest
difficulty in the world not to cut him. He also
insisted upon quarreling with Evelyn or lauding
her beauty while my knife played around
his mouth. This sort of thing went on for a
week or more, when one fine morning I saw
that Harry had rigged up a shooting stand in
the hall of the apartment.</p>

<p>“‘Close the door,’ he cried, ‘and pull the
curtains across. I don’t want the servants to
hear.’ Then he began firing at the target.
Evelyn had been asleep, and hearing shots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
jumped out of bed and began crying: ‘My
God!’ and ‘Mamma;’ likewise promised
‘never to do it again.’”</p>

<p>“Never to do <i>what</i> again?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir.”</p>

<p>“But you were right next to her; why didn’t
you ask her?” insisted Mark.</p>

<p>“But it was her private business,” said the
barber.</p>

<p>“Sure it was, but that was so much more
reason for worming it out of her. You are a
good barber, but a h—— of a reporter.”</p>

<p>“Of course, the floor attendants came trooping
to Thaw’s door and the house telephone
and speaking tubes emitted a volley of questions.</p>

<p>“Harry was prepared to give an impertinent
though truthful answer. But Evelyn took
the phone in hand and swore that it was an
accident, due to her carelessness—Harry had
nothing to do with it, and she was going to
apologize to the management. When things
had quieted down, Thaw told me on the d. q.
that he would transfer his revolver practice
to a certain shooting gallery. ‘I want to be
an A No. 1 shot when I return to New York,’
he said. ‘There is a fellow who has deeply
wronged my girl and I am going to have it out
with him.’”</p>

<p>“People wonder why I spend so much time
abroad,” said Mark Twain at a little luncheon
party in Vienna, where young wine, fresh from
the vat, circulated freely. “One of the reasons
is that I have no doubles in foreign countries,
while in the States I had notice served on me
twice a month on the average that I look
exactly like Mr. Cobbler Smith or Mr. Bricklayer
Brown. I was told they had the very
same warts, in the very same places, where I
sport them—accuracy or imagination, which?
The day before I left New York I got a letter
of that sort and, having booked passage and
nothing to fear, I made bold to answer it.</p>

<p>“‘My dear Sir,’ I wrote. ‘I was so much
impressed by the resemblance that I bear your
face, feet, hands, mustache, eyelids, ears,
hair, eyes, eyebrows, cheeks, and other things,
that I had the portrait of yourself you so
kindly enclosed framed, and hereafter I shall
use it in place of a mirror when I shave.’”</p>

“She was packing.”</p>

</div>


<p>I had been to see Bismarck to help boom
Bryan for the Presidency, when that gentleman
happened to get defeated for the Senate.</p>

<p>“And is old Bismarck still reading those
trashy French novels?” inquired Mark.</p>

<p>“Much worse,” I said.</p>

<p>“Started Paul de Kock over again?”</p>

<p>“Worse still. He is reading Mark Twain
now.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say. Since when the reform?”</p>

<p>“Since his daughter-in-law, Herbert’s wife,
the little Countess Hoyos, gave him a set for
Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Hoyos, Hoyos. I met some people of that
name in Italy.”</p>

<p>“Your fair patroness hails from Trieste, or
neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that Bismarck not only
owns, but reads, my books?” demanded Mark.</p>

<p>“Because he asked me whether there are
still steamer loads of Yankees going picnicking
in Palestine with Mark Twain for a bear-leader.
The old Prince told me he read
‘Innocents Abroad’ twice, and memorized the
best things in it to relate to his grandchildren.”</p>

<p>“Quite a compliment—I <i>do</i> wish Bismarck
hadn’t been such a rascal—in politics, I mean—for
in private life he was quite a gentleman,
I understand. And it is to laugh how, relying
on that, de Blowitz worked the greatest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
scoops during the Berlin Congress. Namely,
about that world-moving affair the ‘London
Times’ for weeks could get no more or better
news than, mayhap, the Brighton Enterprise.
Finally de Blowitz, the Thunderer’s international
representative, lit upon a fourth-rate
secretary in the German foreign office, who
had an exceedingly broad appetite and a correspondingly
narrow pocketbook. De Blowitz
offered to pay for the secretary’s luncheons,
provided the young gentleman would exchange
hats with him daily, the Berliner’s chapeau
concealing certain notes about goings on at
the foreign office under the hat band. Agreed!
By this ruse de Blowitz gathered the whole
Berlin treaty piecemeal and was able to cable
it from Brussels to London even before that
famous document was read in the Congress.”</p>

<p>Mark continued: “If Bismarck had been
the ordinary small-minded statesman, he
would have got on to de Blowitz’s game before
it was half finished, but being a gentleman, he
saw nothing out of the way in the association
of ‘The Times’ correspondent with one of his
secretaries.”</p>

<p>Mark was genuinely proud of Bismarck’s
partiality for his books, even if it came late
in the day.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he once said, “that I gave
Charles Darwin the strength to write some of
his most famous and epoch-making volumes?
How? I am told that, when the great scientist
was utterly fagged out with study, investigation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and with the manifold experiments he
was carrying on, he would read my ‘Innocents’
or ‘Tom Sawyer’ or, maybe a Harper Magazine
story, for a half hour or an hour. Then
he would go to work again and later was ready
for bed. Only when this here Mark Twain
had lulled his nerves into proper condition,
Darwin wooed sleep, I am told, but I can’t
vouch for the truth of this story.”</p>

<p>On another occasion Mark said: “I was
born too late to help ease Lincoln’s hours of
worry. Ward Hill Lamon, whom we met in
Berlin, told me more than once that Lincoln
would have been a constant reader of my
‘literature’ if he had lived long enough to
enjoy my books, and none knew Lincoln
better than Lamon.</p>

<p>“And when my girls admonish me to behave
in company, it always recalls the stories
Lamon told me about old Abe’s awkwardness.</p>

<p>“When Abe and he were riding circuit in
Illinois, they carried their office in their hats,
and Abe contracted the habit of pulling off his
hat from the back so as not to spill any papers.
That was all right on the circuit, but in the
White House it looked undignified. So Mrs.
Lincoln asked Lamon, a most courtly gentleman,
to remonstrate with the President and
teach him to take off his hat ‘decently.’
‘Decently’ was the word she used, said Lamon.
He continued:</p>

<p>“‘I did my best during a night’s smoker,
Mr. Seward helping me, and the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
proved a good enough scholar for any high-school
of courtesy. Eight or ten times he
took off his hat properly, without a reminder
of any sort. Then, at the good-night, I tried
him again. ‘Let’s do it in the right courtly
fashion,’ I said, doffing my chapeau like the
Count of Monte Cristo.</p>

<p>“‘Here goes,’ said the President, reached
his right hand back, and pulled off his stovepipe
in the old Illinois circuit style.”</p>

<p>“You see,” concluded Mark, “it was no use
trying to make a courtier of Lincoln. The
same here.”</p>

VIENNA</h2>
</div>


<p>A day or two after I sent Clemens my translation
of Field Marshal Count Moltke’s
Letters, he called at my hotel in the forenoon
and proposed that we walk to the stock exchange.
The stock exchange, as usual, was
swarming with gentlemen of the Jewish persuasion,
and Mark asked me to pay particular
attention to them.</p>

<p>“They are the smartest of the lot here,” he
insisted, “and so is a Jewish peddler smarter
than a Christian house-owner—I mean the
average. I say it again; the Jews are the
greatest people let loose.</p>

<p>“According to Moltke’s essay in the Letters
you sent me, the Jews ate up Poland. Very
well, the storks eat up frogs. Do we blame the
storks?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARK_AND_THE_PRUSSIAN">MARK AND THE PRUSSIAN
LIEUTENANT</h2>
</div>


<p>Mark liked to be taken around to real German
places, and one day I escorted him to a
Weinstube Unter den Linden, which had quite
a reputation for liquid and other refreshments.
The room we entered was full of lunchers; we
sat down at a small side table that afforded a
good look around. About fifteen feet ahead
of us was a pier glass on the wall between two
windows, and in front of it a table where an
old man with his frau were eating the national
dish with sausage trimmings. The old folks
were enjoying themselves heartily, and, as
Mark put it, “they ate so you can hear them
a mile off, like Chicago millionaires.”</p>

<p>Presently, a young lieutenant strode in,
sword trailing, spurs jingling.</p>

<p>“Look at that,” said Mark. “All the
stupidity and maliciousness of his ancestors,
male and female, for two hundred years back,
is mirrored in his face.”</p>

<p>The junior war lord stalked up the centre
aisle, gave his cap to a bowing waiter, and
stood up in front of the pier glass. Then he
pulled a comb out of one pocket and a brush
out of another, and began “currycombing
himself,” as Mark expressed it. Parting his
hair all the way down to the neck, he brushed
it sideways both ends—over the old people’s
sauerkraut and sausages. Mark kicked at me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
under the table and called me names for not
going and knocking the fellow down.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see, he’s peppering those people’s
dinner with his dandruff,” he said. “Be
a sport and go and kick him well, young
fellow.”</p>

<p>But I knew better. The lieutenant would
have spitted me on the end of his sword before
I could say Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>Gradually Mark’s wrath melted away and
he saw only the funny side of the affair. When
the lieutenant had taken his seat at the table,
he put one knee over the other and ordered his
pea soup on the rough—that is, with the husks
intact.</p>

<p>“Husks are filling, you know,” said Mark,
“or perhaps his stomach is full of chickens.
Chicks like husks; that lieutenant is human,
after all.”</p>

<p>I thought we had seen enough and I encouraged
him to go home.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he said. “I am going to see this
circus to the end. Presently that old woman
will vomit when one of the lieutenant’s bristles
tickles her funny bone, and then she will spew
all over his boots and pants. I am waiting for
that.”</p>

LANGUAGE</h2>
</div>


<p>“Funny that we never took to asses in New
York and other parts of the States,” said
Mark one afternoon as we were passing
through Soho, London. He was watching the
little costermonger carts traveling to and fro
with considerable speed, taking into account
the petty draft animals, the heavy loads and
the boy or girl perched on top.</p>

<p>“The donkeys seem well fed,” mused
Clemens a block or two further on, “but I
don’t like a whip in the driver’s hand. Hear
that,” he cried indignantly, “the rude way
that corduroy-panted chap is talking to his
meek donkey. Let’s listen some more. It’s a
scream.”</p>

<p>After the cart had driven away, Clemens
said: “The patter of the costermonger, when
you come to think of it, is really a language
within the English language, and one might
do worse than give it printed tongue—<i>i. e.</i>,
raise it above the merely occasional use British
writers accord it. I want to look into that
costermongery,” he continued. “See if you
can’t find, hire or steal some coster chap worth
listening to, some one who knows the patter
with all the trimmings.” And at his door he
added: “Get an ‘Arriet,’ for the ‘Arry’s’ are
too tough.”</p>

<p>A week or two later Herbert Beerbohm Tree
found us such a patter artist among the employees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
of Her Majesty’s Theatre—a scrub
lady—and here follow some of the stories she
told us, corrected and amended by Mark,
who cut out coster words not generally understood.</p>

<p>“Stepfather. Thank Gowd! he <i>was</i> a reg’lar

a-flowing and <i>wouldn’t</i> die. But you know
when we moved to ’Ampsted, that settled him.
Those flu winds it was as took ’im off.</p>

<p>“We ’ad a postmortem and everything on
’im, and when they opened ’im you know
they found he had two ulsters in his inside and
there was ’aricot veins in his legs too. But it
was the influential winds that took ’im off,
real.</p>

<p>“Of course Mother ’ad ’im insured in all

him. We all dress alike in this beautiful black.</p>

<p>“On the funeral day we had all our cousins

had a hotch-bone of beef and blanmanges and
jellies and cakes and tarts, and by Gowd! we

she had all that sweep of furniture that he
bought for her at the market for five pounds
($25) and her chest of drawsers besides.
Real, I don’t feel as if I could eat a bit, I
don’t.</p>

<p>“She had to get a barrow, Ada had, and a
wheel came hoff and the pretty pet had to
hold it up with the long broom while the man
was a-pushing of it. But I will say, she has
improved her rooms in moving.</p>

<p>“But it didn’t look at all like a man of <i>his</i>
standing, the governor of a coal cart. And
you can imagine what the neighbors said,
seeing the moving on the barrow and my
pretty pet holding of it up.</p>

<p>“But I <i>must</i> say she got blinds, they are
those Verinkers (Venetians) you ’eard of.
Sure he is a beast, my pretty pet’s man. He
wouldn’t even put up the indecent lights for
her, and she had to pay a man tuppence to do
it for her while she was still a-trembling from
holding up the barrow and that after paying

<p class="ph3">The Troubles of Liz</p>

<p>Liz, the maid-of-all-work, has overstayed
her furlough, and is very emphatic, putting
the blame on Kate.</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t go out with that there Kate
no more, m’am. That Kate do know a lot of
fast chaps. She interdooced me to one and
he kept a-cuddlin’ of me round the neck and
near pushed my hat off, you see it’s all awry.
And he kept a-pinching of me about and
arsked if it was all my own figger. But he did
say <i>Dear</i> to me.”</p>

<p>Liz’s next place was with a butcher’s, but
there they “were real rude” to her, and she
left, of course. This is her report of what
happened:</p>

<p>“‘Here, Liz,’ said one of the helpers to me,
‘there’s two kidneys for my tea. Take a care,
you got two like that.’ Oh, I can’t stay in a
place where they talk as fast as that, just as
if I had kidneys like a cow.</p>

<p>“And the other chap comes and brings me a
bit of liver to cook for <i>his</i> tea, and he says:
‘Liz, you know you’ve got a liver just like
that?’ I just ran upstairs and told the missus.
And in the evening one brings me a pig’s head
with a squint in his eye and he says, ‘Liz, this
is what you do to the boys—give ’em the glad
eye.’ No, I won’t stop, as true as there is
Gowds in ’eaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>Her next place was with a benevolent old
spinster. Liz left her service, saying: “I had
no wages, and what do you think she did?
Why, she has locked up the tarts. And the
other day I was making myself a bit of toast
and margarine and the old cat caught me at
it and she said, ‘Isn’t dripping not good
enough for you, Liz?’”</p>

</div>


<p>One night in his dressing-room, Sir Herbert
Tree introduced us to another promising story-teller,
namely, the French madame who looked
after “the ladies of the chorus, who raise a
shapely leg before us.” (That was a popular
sing-song then and Mark heartily enjoyed
it.) She told Clemens of a stroke of good
luck that had befallen her and he declared
himself tickled to death with her French-English,
which, he said, was every bit as good
as his own English-French. Tree kindly lent
us “Basil,” his stenographer and “memory,”
to jot down the yarn.</p>

<p>“<i>Mais non</i>, Madame, we will have ze leedle

<p>“Listen. As M. Raymond stayed till 1,
3, 4th o’clock in the morning at the Lib’ral
Club, I was told one or two or three leedle
things about him, but of course I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>

he did not come at ze 4th in the morning, I get
up and dress myself and go arounds to ze
Lib’ral Club and does bash bangs at zat door.</p>

<p>“And presently a head comes out of ze

<p>“‘He is not ’ere, Madame. Ze Club always

<p>“‘I thank you, Monsieur, sorry to trouble

I had been told and I jus’ go rounds ze corner
and I listen down ze aria and hear sounds of

<p>“A policeman he stood at ze corner. I says

<p>“He says, ‘What you do to my wife, you

<p>“I says, ‘She will not give me my ’usband.’</p>

</div>


<p>This story was told by Clemens at the American
Embassy, Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>“She was the littlest, the sweetest maiden
of about ten I have ever seen, and she came
dancing up to me with a smile and wink that
was simply bewitching. I was going home to
27 Fifth Avenue after a tiresome dinner where
I had to make a speech (<i>had</i> to—God bless the
organizer of the dinner, for I won’t), and I was
as tired as two dogs and as grumpy as seven
bears, when this vision suddenly burst upon
me. I saw at once that the little one was as
happy as a lark, and naturally I beamed on
her, for I love children.</p>

<p>“As she was tripping along just as if I had
been her grandpa—trusting me with little
confidences and petting my arm, she prattled
about the moon that would soon come up and
the bogies and the bats and about the fright
they gave her, and I said:</p>

<p>“‘Little maid, hadn’t you better go home?
Your mother may be anxious about you.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, no,’ she said; ‘mamma knows I am
out and she is at the window watching. She
knows that I am walking with you, for I
wanted to a lot of times.’</p>

<p>“Well, I felt as proud as Pierpont Morgan
on discovering a Fifteenth Century missal and
buying it for five dollars. And in my mind I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
patted myself on the back, and said: ‘Mark,
old boy, they <i>do</i> love you, all of them.’ Really,
I felt tickled all over, and I don’t know how
many thousands of words at fifty cents ‘per’
that kid wheedled out of me by way of answers
to her questions and by way of compliments.
She was a princess kid, I tell you.
When we arrived at No. 27, I insisted upon
taking her back to her home and there formally
saying good-by to her. Indeed I would have
liked to kiss that little lady, but as her mother
was at the window I didn’t dare. And that
kid kept on talking. If her words had been
buns, single handed she could have beaten
Fleischman with all his hundreds of bakers.
But what puzzled me was that she was forever
talking about selling tickets and how nice it
must be to take so much cash for tickets. I
thought, of course, she was referring to tickets
at church festivals and, to increase my credit
with her, I said that I bought lots of them
and that people took chances on my books
and sometimes I took chances myself and got
burdened with some to cart home.”</p>

<p>“‘Oh, you write books, too?’ she said.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes,’ I said. ‘I am a sort of bookworm,
and here is your home and now you
must go in, for it is getting late and the bats
and the bogies are coming. Good-night, little
lady, and sleep well, and when you are a big
girl and have a husband and a house and a
motor car, then you can tell your friends that
once you walked with Mark Twain——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“‘Mark Train! I never heard of him.’</p>

<p>“As I looked at my adoring and adorable
little friend her lip began to quiver. It quivered
still more, her blue eyes filled—could not
hold the tears—they dropped down on her
face and on my flattered hand.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, sir,’ she sobbed, drawing away from
me (I thought she was broken-hearted because
she had to leave me)—‘Oh,’ she said, ‘I
thought you were Buffalo Bill.’”</p>

<p>Some of the biographers of Mark Twain
have made a lot of his sufferings by rheumatism
while in Berlin. I saw him almost daily,
except when he was down with bronchitis,
and I heard very few complaints from him <i>re</i>
rheumatism. Occasionally he said, “My
damned arm has done some howling in the
night.” But when out of bed, it never
“howled” badly enough to prevent him from
writing or holding a book. He was scribbling
most of the time, when not talking or riding,
or walking, and when I saw him in his “Mattress
Mausoleum” (as he called his bed), he
handled pipe, papers, knife and books freely.
I honestly believe much of that rheumatism
scare was put on. For Mark liked leisure
above all things. When he did not feel like
writing, he told Livy he “had it bad,” and
escaped a scolding. “Livy” was an excellent
wife to him, but she had the commercial spirit
that Mark lacked—and God knows he needed
prodding once in a while.</p>

<p>Mark Twain always liked to talk about “La
Mouche, Heine’s girl-friend-to-the-death.”
One morning, at the British Museum, he made
me hunt through dozens of books, French,
German and Italian, for her real name: Camille
Seldon.</p>

<p>“So she wasn’t German,” he said. “I
thought so, for a German girl, by her innate
heaviness, might have spoiled that nimbleness
of language we admire in Heine. Goethe’s
girls, as their portraits show, were all beefy
things—no, not all, I except Gretchen—hence
Goethe’s Olympian periods, his ponderous
style. It’s wrong, I think, to credit Camille
with mere physical influence on Heine. Her
limpid French conversation, I take it, aided
in imparting to his French verse that airy,
fairy lightness which a foreigner rarely commands.”</p>

<p>Some one reminded Clemens that Camille
also had been the friend of Taine.</p>

<p>“A lucky girl! The most poesy-saturated
of poets and the Father of English literature!
I call him the Father,” he added, “because he
made so many people read serious books
which without his advice and encouragement
they would never have tackled.”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t got an ounce of envy in me.
I once tried hard to get envious, but happily
my wife interfered. I had to forget about it
and turn my mind into other, cleaner channels.
That was on our first trip to Europe, in 1878.
On the ship we met Bayard Taylor, the poet,
bound for Berlin, as ambassador to Bismarck.
That, I believe, states the case more correctly
than the official ‘ambassador to the Court of
Berlin.’</p>

<p>“Well, Bayard made me feel pretty cheap
by his display of German. That fellow was
forever talking, thinking and writing German.
Compared with his, my own miserable German
vocabulary was an ant-hill facing Chimborazo.
And when I heard him recite whole acts of his
metric translation of Faust, I wished myself
in his shoes, for I certainly did envy the man
his Teuton knowledge. However, when I told
Livy about it, she warned me and made me
promise to suppress the nasty habit. Well
done, for Bayard Taylor died within five or
six months, at the age of fifty-three.”</p>

<p>When we were about to pass the French
Embassy in Berlin one afternoon, Mark
dragged me across the street, saying:</p>

<p>“See those horses? That Kaiser is in there,
making love to the Ambassador’s wife. I
don’t want to meet him as he comes out or
when he is thrown out, as he ought to be.”</p>

<p>At that moment a very distinguished
English-looking gentleman passed us in a
cab, raising his hat to Mark.</p>

<p>“Do you know him?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“I have seen him in Fleet Street, I believe,
but I don’t know where to put him. As you
know, my eyes don’t travel far these days.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Mark, “this is ‘Labby’
(Labouchère) of London ‘Truth,’ the Baron-maker.
I call him that because he actually
put hundreds of barons into the world, if
not into the peerage—namely, when he acted
as Secretary of the British Embassy in Paris
and had the issuing of passports in hand.
Suppose John Smith and Mary Smith, British
subjects, toddled in and asked for their
papers. Labby would look them over carefully
and if their persons and address lent
itself to the scheme, would make out the
paper for ‘Sir John’ and ‘Lady Mary.’
Of course the people stuck to the title,
acquired under the government seal, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
rest of their lives. Indeed, most of the
Labby-created nobles by and by gained
popular recognition as the real thing—baronets
and baronesses. On Labby’s part it
was all fun—burlesque pure and simple.
Himself a noble by birth, he thought the
nobility a stupid and useless institution these
days, and if the prime minister—a commoner—could
make dukes and princes, why
could not he, Labby, at least make Sirs
and Ladies? But of course when the government
got wise to it, Labby got the sack.
Just the same, he’s the smartest Englishman
I’ve met. By Jingo, I would like to hear his
last words on this planet of ours even as I
would like to have heard Heine’s grand:
‘Never mind my sins, God will forgive them.
Forgiving is his business.’”</p>

<p>Of the pair of geniuses, Mark died first
(April 21, 1910), and both left characteristic
utterances. Mark said to his physician:</p>

<p>“Good-by. <i>If</i> we meet——”</p>

<p>Labouchère, shortly before his end, had
been lectured by a sister or brother on the
godless life he had led and had been assured
that, if God didn’t take pity on him, he
would certainly go to a hot place. An hour
or so after listening to these comforting
remarks, Labouchère had what Twain called
on another occasion a “fair wind for Paradise,”
<i>i. e.</i>, he was dying and knew it. Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it happened that during the last half-minute
of his life a spirit lamp in the next room
exploded with a loud bang. Labouchère
raised his head a bit and said feebly:</p>

<p>“What—<i>already</i>?”</p>

<p>One more gasp and he was dead. How
Mark would have enjoyed Labby’s: “What,
already?”</p>

</div>


<p>With Richard Harding Davis I had covered
the coronation of the Czar in Moscow and
Mark could never get enough of that trip,
asking me a thousand questions about the
country and people. But what most interested
him was the fact that they had taken
Carlyle’s Cromwell away from me at the
frontier. “You can have it back when you
return,” said the Russian customs people,
but they stuck to my book just the same.</p>

<p>“Maybe they will start a revolution on
the strength of Carlyle,” said Mark. “I
hope they will.”</p>

<p>“Talking of Cromwell—I am glad they
have no Westminster Abbey in the States.
And here is why. This man Cromwell was
alternately an anarchist and an autocrat.
More powerful than any king, he refused the
crown, yet made Parliament accept his imbecile
son as his successor. They buried
him in Westminster Abbey with all the
honors due a king and after two years dragged
his body out and beheaded the poor carcass,
then stuck the head on a pike, mounted on
Parliament House. You say even if we had
a Westminster Abbey in America and I was
buried there, yet the things that happened
to Cromwell could never happen to me.
But I don’t know about that. When I was
in Paris last, somebody offered me a tooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
out of the head of Turenne, who had been
buried two hundred years or more. How
did he get that tooth? Why, during the
revolution the Jacobins—ancestors of our
present-day anarchists—smashed the royal
graves at Saint Denis and flung the royal
bones to the winds. Turenne happened to
have been buried among his peers at the
feet of Louis XIV. That is the reason why
he was dispossessed. Now comes a commercially
inclined Frenchman who had read
that Turenne had been blessed with exceptionally
fine molars. So he breaks all
the teeth out of the dead man’s jaws and
sells them to the highest bidder. I was
told there was only one left and I could have
it for 100 francs. But I was more interested
in my own teeth than in Turenne’s and
refused to do business with the antiquarian.
However, to have my little joke I said to
him, ‘If you had the “Henri Quatre” of the
4th Henry I might buy.’</p>

<p>“‘The Jacobins plucked that out, too,’ he
replied, ‘but there isn’t a hair left for sale
nowadays. However, I may locate one or
more by diligent hunting and I’ll let you
know if I succeed.’</p>

<p>“Think of it! Henri Quatre’s Henri Quatre
torn out by the roots and sold at so much
per hair! That mustache and goatee that
was next to so many sweet lips—the sweetest
in France. I have seen the originals of some
of his letters in the Musée de Cluny, Paris,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and had some of those little masterpieces
of grace translated for me.”</p>

<p>Mark took out his Paris notebook and read:</p>

<p>“‘My true heart,’ he wrote at one time
to Diane de Poitiers, ‘you have lied. I
shall not see you for ten days. It is enough
to kill me. I will not tell you how much I
care, it would make you too vain, and I
think you love me, so with a happy heart I
finish.’</p>

<p>“In answer Diane wrote back, ‘If I die,
have me opened and you will find your image
engraved on my heart.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARK_ON_LINCOLNS_HUMANITY">MARK ON LINCOLN’S HUMANITY</h2>
</div>


<p>When Ida M. Tarbell’s “Life of Lincoln”
was running in McClure’s during the late
nineties, Mark said at luncheon at the Cafe
Ronacher, Vienna, one afternoon: “That
woman is writing a wonderfully good and
accurate, intimate and comprehensive book
and I <i>do</i> hope that, in the end, she will give
the same prominence to Lincoln’s correspondence
on pardons as to other state papers
of his. When you come to think of it, a
lot of nonentities have got credit for able
state papers, but it takes humanity to commute
a sentence of death and Lincoln has
commuted thousands. The only one he
didn’t and couldn’t commute was one imposed
by our friend, Ward Hill Lamon.</p>

<p>“Lamon, then Marshal of the District of
Columbia, had seen Lincoln safely home and
then made his usual rounds of the White
House grounds. All seemed well, no cause
for suspicion, Ward told me, and he was
about to retire, when he thought he saw some
movement amid a clump of green foliage.
It looked as if a body was rising from the
ground.</p>

<p>“‘I reached the spot by three leaps, faced
a dark figure and, without ado, dealt him a
blow square between the eyes, knocking him
down,’ said the Marshal.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Mark, “you know
Lamon as he looks now, still a commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
figure, though worried and weakened by
diabetes. In the early sixties he was a
giant, a John L. Sullivan as a hitter. That
blow of his killed the stranger in the White
House grounds and when the body was
carried to the Secret Service offices and
searched, they found it to be that of a Southern
gentleman of distinguished family. He
had two pistols and two heinous looking
knives on him—undoubtedly Ward had stopped
short the career of one of the forerunners
of John Wilkes Booth, postponing the great
tragedy several months—I have forgotten the
date. Wait, it happened during the night
when Lamon brought the President back
from the Soldiers’ Home, outside of Washington.</p>

<p>“Lincoln’s visit to the Soldiers’ Home was
not on the schedule, Lamon told me, and he
was surprised and angered when, calling at
the White House, he heard of his riding away
all by himself, for it was just such opportunities
as would-be assassins were looking for.</p>

<p>“At the stables Lamon learned that the
President came there in person, ordered ‘Old
Abe,’ his favorite army mule, saddled and,
half an hour ago, rode away as carelessly as
any private citizen might do. There was a
grain of comfort in the character of the
mount selected, for ‘Old Abe’ wouldn’t go
faster than a dogtrot if you beat him to
death. So Lamon selected the fastest horse
he could borrow and in a twinkling was en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
route for the Soldiers’ Home. As calculated,
he met the President half-way down the
road and Lincoln, far from suspecting that
the Marshal was on his trail, invited him to
come along and have some fun. Well, the
President had a jolly time at the Soldiers’
Home, swapping stories with veterans and
boys, listening to the singing, declaiming
poetry and forgetting the care of his exalted
office.</p>

<p>“And he kept up the fun on the way home,
talking to his mule and explaining to ‘Old
Abe’ what a ‘Misery’ Hill was. (He always
used to call Lamon by his second name.)
Hill, the President told his namesake, was
always looking for danger, always suspecting
somebody, never content with the troubles
one couldn’t escape, etc., etc. But while
Lamon laughed at the President’s sallies and
encouraged his carefree humor, he kept both
eyes open and if anything or anybody had
stirred in front, back or at the sides of the
road, his revolver was ready for emergency.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_ENGLISH_LOVER_OF_KINGS">AN ENGLISH LOVER OF KINGS
AND A HATER</h2>
</div>


<p>“Look at those fools going to pieces over
old Doc Johnson—call themselves Americans
and lick-spittle the toady who grabbed a
pension from the German King of England
that hated Americans, tried to flog us into
obedience and called George Washington
traitor and scoundrel.”</p>

<p>Thus spoke Mark Twain in the Doctor
Johnson room of the Cheshire Cheese, the
Strand, where the old thoroughfare becomes
“the Street of Ink” or Newspaper Row, and
while we were enjoying the famous meat
pie served there on certain days of the week.</p>

<p>“You are pleased to occupy Miss Evelyn’s
seat,” whispered James the waiter, looking
at Mark.</p>

<p>“Miss Evelyn—what?” demanded our
friend.</p>

<p>James blushed. “Miss Evelyn, why—Miss
Evelyn, the beautiful young American
lady who came with the millionaire, Mr.
Harry Thaw. While she was in London I
always had to keep for her the seat under
the Doctor’s portrait on pie-day.”</p>

<p>“Not because she loved Johnson better,
but because she liked being in the limelight
worse,” commented Mark.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he continued, “no Englishman
misses doing the kowtow to Johnson
when he’s got half a chance, but of our own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
people, coming to the Cheese, ninety-nine
per cent. do so because they don’t know the
man, and the others because they feel tickled
to honor a writer a hundred and fifty years
or so after he is good and rotten.”</p>

<p>“Read Johnson plentifully, I suppose,”
mocked Bram Stoker, famous as author,
critic, barrister and Henry Irving’s associate.</p>

<p>“Not guilty—never a written word of his,”
answered honest Mark. “I gauge Johnson’s
character by his talks with that sot Bozzy,
whom foolish old Carlyle called the greatest
biographer ever because, I suppose, Bozzy
interviewed Johnson on such momentous
questions as: ‘What would you do, sir, if
you were locked up in the Tower with a
baby?’”</p>

<p>“Well, what would <i>you</i> do,” asked Bram.</p>

<p>“Throw it out of the window to a passing
milkman, if it was weaned and if there was
no cow around,” said Mark.</p>

<p>When the merriment had subsided, Mark
continued the slaughter of Johnson: “Why,
he was a man who would have called brother
a cannibal island king who had eaten a Jesuit,
while he would have mobilized the whole
British fleet against savages who dined off an
Episcopalian.”</p>

<p>“And if they had fried a Bishop of the
established Church down in the Pacific?”</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier,” answered
Mark. “For all I know Johnson may have
been the guy who invented a seething lake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
of fire and brimstone de luxe for married
couples who had loved wisely and too well
on a Christian holiday.”</p>

<p>“Boldly stolen from Voltaire,” suggested
Bram.</p>

<p>“No, I read about the lake in one of
Anatole France’s weekly essays in ‘Le Temps,’
but there was no reference to Johnson, of
course.</p>

<p>“Speaking of Voltaire—I don’t remember
that he mentioned Johnson in his English
Letters, though he did take the trouble (in
Eighteenth Century French ignorance) to
call Shakespeare ‘a drunken savage,’ ‘an
amazing genius’ and ‘an indecent buffoon who
had rendered English taste a ruined lady for
two hundred years to come.’”</p>

<p>“Date’s quite correct, as I once pointed
out to poor Gene Field,” interrupted Stoker.
He called for a slate—they had no paper at
the Cheese—and scrawled:</p>

<p>“As you see,” added Bram, “Voltaire was
out only a little more than half a century.
And what’s half a century when the Oxford
Dodo—if the moths hadn’t eaten him—would
now be seven and twenty trillions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
years old? But go on with your Voltaire,
Mark.”</p>

<p>“You mean Johnson,” said Mark; “how
he would have cackled had he known that
Voltaire got his start in literature by the
library he bought as a youngster out of Ninon
de l’Enclos’ two thousand livres bequest.
‘Authorship reared on a wench’s patrimony,’
I hear him expectorate, and George Rex
would have been tickled to death, for Johnson,
he would have argued, has now extracted
the sting from the Frenchman’s
description of Kings, as ‘a pack of rogues and
highwaymen.’”</p>

<p>As he was speaking Mark grabbed hold of
his elbow, indulging in a grimace of pain.
“What’s the date?” he demanded abruptly.</p>

<p>“August 25th.”</p>

<p>“Late, as usual,” said Mark with mock
mournfulness. “True friends of mankind and
haters of intolerance have their rheumatism
or colic on August 24th, the day of the Massacre
of St. Bartholomew. Voltaire always
timed his boils so and got a rash or the itch
on May 14th for good measure.”</p>

<p>“What happened on May 14th?”</p>

<p>“Why, you ignoramus, on May 14th, in
the year I have forgot, the humanest and
royalest of kings, Henri IV, was assassinated
by a damned monk.”</p>

<p>It was in Koernerstrasse No. 7, of course,
and it happened in this way. Mark, his wife,
Mrs. Crane, the three children, and the governess
were having breakfast when Gretchen
came in, excitement written all over her face;
as Mark said: “You could hear her heart
beat. There was a frightful commotion under
her shirtwaist.”</p>

<p>“‘Gracious Lord,’ she said, addressing me,
‘there is a Mister Policeman outside who
wants to see you, Gracious Lord.’</p>

<p>“‘Tell him to go to blazes,’ I said, Susan
translating the American classic into even
more classic German.</p>

<p>“‘My God,’ groaned Gretchen, ‘I could
never say anything like that to a Mister
Policeman. He is a Mister <i>Policeman</i>, don’t
you understand, Gracious Lord?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ I said, ‘I haven’t had any breakfast,
and if the Kaiser himself called I would
throw him out.’</p>

<p>“At this moment there was a peremptory
knock at the door and a raspy voice bellowed:</p>

<p>“‘Wird’s bald?’ (Aren’t you coming?)</p>

<p>“Now I got real mad and telling Susie to
get the revolver we didn’t have in the house,
I went to the door.</p>

<p>“‘I am Mr. Clemens,’ I said to the limb
of the law. ‘What do you want at this
unearthly hour, of an American citizen?
More taxes? I have paid taxes on a dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
which I don’t own, and I paid church taxes
although I never go to church. I am tired
of your tax rot. I won’t pay another pfennig.’</p>

<p>“‘Take a care, Herr Clemens,’ warned
the mister policeman. ‘I heard you mention
the name of our All Gracious Kaiser, and
now you talk like an anarchist. We won’t
stand for that in Berlin.’</p>

<p>“‘Who are we?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘The police,’ he answered.</p>

<p>“‘Well, tell the police to——!’</p>

<p>“And no sooner had I uttered that revolutionary
platitude when the mister policeman
dumped his helmet on his frowzy bean,
knocked his heels together, and put his right
hand on his sword hilt and sang out:</p>

<p>“‘Herr, you are under arrest.’</p>

<p>“Whereupon all the women of the household
and all the listening neighbors were
petrified with terror. But I laughed to beat
the band to hide my cowardice. My hilarity
took the mister policeman off his perch for
the moment, and he said:</p>

<p>“‘What are you laughing at?’</p>

<p>“I answered: ‘I am tickled because you
threaten me with jail, with the gallows perhaps,
and don’t know enough to state the
nature of my crime.’</p>

<p>“‘That’s easy, you are arrested for a breach
of the city regulations. You allowed your
servants to put the bedclothes near the
window, and when I stand on tiptoes on the
other side of the street, I can see them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“I laughed again. He repeated that I was
under arrest, and ordered me to come to
court the next morning at nine.</p>

<p>“So next morning at nine I went to court,
the legation having furnished me with a
lawyer. When the judge came in, I rose
like everybody else to salute His Honor,
then settled down to watch proceedings, and
without wishing to be offensive, of course,
I slung one knee over the other. Thereupon,
the judge called me to the bar and fined me
twenty marks for indecent behavior. In a
German court I was expected to bend, not
cross, my knees. Next my case was called
and, as the court was possibly prejudiced on
account of the knee incident, I was fined ten
marks for showing perfectly clean linen, and
twenty marks for laughing at a mister policeman.
It cost me fifty marks ($12.50) all in
all and I expected to make about five hundred
dollars writing about my disgrace. However,
Livy thought the telling of it would
deal the family escutcheon a blow from which
it could never hope to recover and so I had
to stick to my five-cent stogies the same as
the mister policeman.”</p>

<p>As every friend of Mark Twain’s writings
knows, Mark was never short on literary projects,
and at the time of their conception
all looked exceedingly good to him. As a
rule he would start work on the new subject
at once with enthusiasm unlimited, writing,
dictating, rewriting, dictaphoning and what
not! Small wonder that the waiters at the
Hotel Metropole in Vienna called him a
“dictator.” However, not infrequently his
golden imaginings proved idle dross, or else
were put aside for new fancies. During his
Berlin season he was very keen, at one time,
on writing a book on the Three Charles’s,
dealing with a terzetto of crowned rascals,
but the project, like so many others, was
abandoned or died. If I remember rightly,
Clemens told me, either in Vienna or London,
that he might have felt stronger on the Three
Charles’s if it wasn’t for Thackeray’s Four
Georges.</p>

<p>The Three Charles’s idea was born of this
slight incident:</p>

<p>We had met at the famous Cafe Bauer,
Herr Bamberger, some time private secretary
to Charles of Brunswick, better known
as the Diamond Duke. Bamberger told us
some racy stories about the late Highness
who had left a million to a Swiss town on
condition that it set up a monument to his
memory. The monument was built, but so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
faultily that after six months or so it tumbled
down. And the débris having been carted
away, Charles’ dream of glory came to an
abrupt end.</p>

<p>Mark and Bamberger had several more
interviews and one morning, at the Legation,
Clemens announced that his next book would
be “The Three Charles’s,” Charles the First
and the Second of England and Charles of
Brunswick, who was also partly English.</p>

<p>“In all his long life,” said Mark, “the
Brunswick Charles did only one decent thing
and that was a lie. ‘Here reposes the murdered
Queen of England,’ he had chiselled
upon the entrance to the mausoleum harboring
the remains of Queen Charlotte, wife of
George. Now this fellow George knew more
about buttons for a waistcoat, or sauce for
a partridge, than about kingship, he fought—but
certainly did not murder his wife. On
the other hand, Bamberger tells me, that the
Brunswick Charles poisoned a number of
people while playing at kingship. Yet all
the punishment he got at the hands of his
loving subjects was the dirty kick-out. They
burned his palace, besides, but later had to
rebuild it at their own cost. In short, get
the true picture of Charles and loathe royalty
ever afterwards,” recommended Mark.</p>

<p>“You can’t conceive of the meanness of
this German kinglet,” said Mark at another
time. “Once he had trouble with a courtier,
Baron Cramner. The Baron fled to escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
a dose of <i>aqua toffana</i>, but his wife, who
expected her first baby, had to remain in
Brunswick. What does Charles do? He
forbids all physicians, surgeons and midwives,
on pain of imprisonment and loss of
license, to attend her Ladyship. And he
set spies about her house to be informed of
the time of travail. And when she was in
agony, he had a huge mass of powder, said
Bamberger, five thousand pounds, exploded
in the neighborhood of her residence. There
are a hundred more stories like that. After
he fled from Brunswick, the Duke’s medicine
chest was found to be crammed full of
poison bottles and powders, the label of each
container showing how often employed and
how long it took for the poison to work.</p>

<p>“This Diamond Duke got away with
eleven million thalers of the people’s money;
he left one million thalers behind because
he couldn’t get at them. And that notwithstanding,
this murderer and thief was
allowed to live the life of a distinguished
prince in London and Paris. Wait till I get
through with him and his namesakes in the
royalty business.”</p>

<p>Mark and I were walking through a rather
disreputable little street, lined by private
hotels, which leads from the Strand to the
Playhouse, London, when he suddenly stopped
and pointed to a bronze tablet on an
old house about the middle of the block.</p>

<p>“Read,” he commanded, but my eyes
refused to climb to the second story.</p>

<p>“Why this used to be the abode of the poet
who has said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The English love Liberty as their wife,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Heine,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I am not absolutely
sure, that Heine coined that political document,”
admitted Mark, “but it is very much
in the manner of an epigram he <i>did</i> write, I
believe.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I confess I heard this, too, for the first
time; possibly Mark got off the fireworks
all by his loneness, <i>pour passer le temps</i>.</p>

<p>“Howells introduced me to Heine,” he
explained during the entr’acte. “I am glad
he did, for I never found in his writings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
‘the bitter Jew who emptied all the insult
in his soul on Aryan heads.’ But then I
read Heine only for his glittering wit, the

HACK-WRITER</h2>
</div>


<p>A Berlin cartoon paper, “Ulk,” once represented
Twain as “an Arthurian Knight,
canned up to the neck in armour,” galloping
after kill-joys and such, and picking them
up with his lance and warhooping like wild.
That’s what he would like to have done to
the hack of a London publishing house, who
had interfered with his copy, striking out
sentences, and words, and substituting his
own “insular ignorance” wherever Mark’s
broad humanity ran amuck of public opinion
as he, the hack, understood it.</p>

<p>Mark told me that he spent three days
“abolishing that cad” (quoting from Carlyle)
and I think he added:</p>

<p>“I gave him at least part of the Hades
and brimstone he deserved. There were
such moving passages as ‘monumental ass,’
‘masticator of commonplaces,’ ‘offspring of
a court fool,’ ‘clownish idiot,’ etc. All the
hatred, all the venom that was in my system
I let loose upon that damn’ fool, squirted it
into him with all the force that I was capable
of. Oh, I laid him out. If he had had the
chance to read the letter, his own mother
would not have recognized him.</p>

<p>“But, as you may have heard, women
know these things better, and Livy destroyed
that wonderful letter of mine, burned it up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
or fed it to the chickens—I don’t know which.
Anyhow the letter wasn’t mailed and that
English fool thinks to this very day that he
flabbergasted me.”</p>

</div>


<p>I was telling Mark about some frolic at
the Berlin Court, when the sprightly “Lottchen,”
Princess of Meiningen, William’s
sister, proposed a riddle that puzzled the
exalted, but not too quick-witted company—</p>

<p>“Even to the utmost—I know what you
want to say. They tell me they are having
the charade-fever at the Schloss, is that it?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” I answered, and went on to
tell of the silly rebus competitions in which
the Kaiser took special delight. I had my
story from the Baroness Von Larisch, a witness,
who enjoyed a photographic memory.</p>

<p>“A movie memory,” corrected Mark, “but
go on.”</p>

<p>Well, I reported, H. R. H. quoted nine or
ten descriptions of the party to be guessed
at, and neither the Majesties, nor the Highnesses,
nor the Graces, nor the Disgraces
came anywhere near the solution. Whereupon
Lottchen startled the company by
announcing the answer: “Joan of Arc.”</p>

<p>Twain took the cigar out of his mouth and
sat up straight, which, as everybody knows,
he did only on rare occasions.</p>

<p>“Blasphemy most horrible!” he thundered,
“making a joke of Joan of Arc, <i>my</i> Joan of
Arc!”</p>

<p>“Your book isn’t out yet,” I said by way
of pouring oil on troubled waters. “And until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
it sees the light of print people <i>will</i> puzzle
whether your Joan was saint, witch, man,
maid or something else.”</p>

<p>Mark had replaced his cigar and was now
chewing it viciously.</p>

<p>“Let’s have the story,” he said. While
he read Joan of Arc’s ephemeral epitaph,
quoted by Lottchen, the stern lines of his
face gradually softened and coming to the
end, he laughed outright. “Tiptop,” he
chuckled, “I wish I had done these verses
myself. But, of course, if I had thought of
them fifteen or more years ago, I would
never have taken Joan seriously.”</p>

<p>The verses that amused the great humorist,
read as follows:</p>

<p>Moberly Bell, the last great editor of
“The Times,” London, before Northcliffe,
was not nearly so Olympian as people thought
who had never met him. I often warmed
one of the enormous armchairs in his enormous
office—Bell was a six-footer, as broad
as an ox, and his room at the Thunderer’s
office resembled a cathedral rather than the
ordinary editorial cubby-hole. I brought
over Mark one afternoon and he told Bell
of the trouble he had buying “The Times”
at “The Times” office.</p>

<p>“I offered my sixpence across the counter,
saying ‘Today’s paper, please,’” he drawled,
“but was quickly put to the right-about.
‘You will find the commissioner outside, at
the door; he will fetch the paper and accept
payment if you are not a regular subscriber,’
I was rebuked.</p>

<p>“Well I looked outside and instead of a
commissioner found a field marshal, as big
as a house, hung with medals, and festooned
with silver lace.</p>

<p>“‘Your excellency,’ I murmured distractedly,
‘I was ordered to find the commissioner
to fetch me a paper. May I be so
bold as to ask whether you have seen that
individual?’</p>

<p>“The field marshal touched his three-cornered
hat and replied in the most stately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and dignified manner: ‘Why, of course, I
will get you a paper, Mr. Clemens, if you
will deign to wait five or six minutes.’</p>

<p>“Then it was <i>my</i> turn to put on airs,”
concluded Mark. “‘I am going to see Mr.
Moberly Bell,’ I said; ‘fetch me the paper
upstairs and keep the change.’”</p>

<p>We were still laughing when a copy boy
entered with a trayful of dispatches. “Allow
me,” said Mr. Bell. “It will take but a minute
to skim over these wires.” But he interrupted
himself immediately.</p>

<p>“There’s a job for you, Fisher,” he said,
handing me a Paris dispatch. “Blowitz cables
that your Aunt Rosine is dying. Hope she
will leave you a lot of money. ‘The Times’
will take eight hundred words on Rosine,
sixpence a word, you know. Let me have
them by seven to-night.”</p>

<p>“My, I wish I had an aunt that I could
make sixpence a word out of,” said Mark,
as we were going down the lift, which is
British for elevator. “Who is, or was, this
relative of yours in which ‘The Times’ is interested
to the extent of eight hundred
words?”</p>

<p>“Why Rosine Stoltz, whom Verdi called
‘his divine inspiration,’ the creator of Aida
and of the title roles of most of Rossini’s
Grand Operas.”</p>

<p>“That’s a jolly mouthful,” assented Mark,
“but couldn’t she do anything but sing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“She was not only the solitary rival ever
recognized by Jenny Lind, but the greatest
collector of titles ever,” I replied. “De
Blowitz calls her the Duchess of L’Esignano,
but she was also the Spanish Princess of
Peace, the Princess Godoy, the Marchioness
of Altavilla and the Countess and Baroness
of Ketchendorff.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mark, “that story
about her dying is vastly exaggerated, for
she has six lives coming to her before she is
finally through. But how and where did
she get all those high-sounding names?”</p>

<p>“Bought ’em, of course. Her last husband,
the Prince Godoy, was a racetrack tout in
Paris and they were married on his highness’
deathbed, Auntie engaging to pay
the funeral expenses. L’Esignano and Altavilla
she likewise married <i>in extremis</i>, as
lawyers have it. The Barony and the Countship
she acquired through her lover, the
saintly Prince Albert, husband of Victoria.”</p>

<p>“She was a Frenchwoman, you said?”</p>

<p>“Born in Paris as Victoire Noel.”</p>

<p>Mark Twain stood still in the midst of
Printing House Square and laid a heavy
hand upon my arm. “What you tell me is
a great relief,” he said. “I thought American
girls were the only damn’ fools paying for
titles.”</p>

<p>The much-titled Aunt Rosine didn’t die
till a year later, but I believe that the false
alarm about her demise, set down, was responsible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
in part at least, for Mark’s: “Do
They Love a Lord?” He maintained: “They
all do,” dwelling in particular upon the
courtesies shown to Prince Henry in the U. S.
After the appearance of his essay in “The
North American Review,” I told Clemens
of the following incident, witnessed in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>I happened to visit the City of Brotherly
Love the same day as Henry and was crossing
one of the downtown squares, when a considerable
commotion arose behind: clatter
of horses’ hoofs, jingling of metal, tramp of
oncoming masses. Somebody shouted:
“There he is, going to the Mayor’s office,”
as I was passing by an office building in
course of construction.</p>

<p>The masons, hodcarriers and other workmen
heard the cry and crowded onto the
scaffolding outside the walls. Some of them
seemed ready to take up the shouts of
welcome emitted here and there by the
crowd.</p>

<p>But the enthusiasm for royalty was cut
short by a brawny Irishman, planting himself,
trowel in hand, on the edge of the main
scaffold.</p>

<p>“None of that chin music here,” he hollered;
“the first wan that hollers hooray for
owld Vic’s grandson gets a throwl full of
cement down his red lane,” and he swung
the loaded tray defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Just then the Pennsylvania Hussars came
trotting up in picturesque disorder, the Prince
and city officials following in an open landau.</p>

<p>“And you could <i>hear</i> the silence, I bet,”
said Mark. “I wish I had been there to <i>see</i> it
too, particularly if one of the chaps had attempted
to mutiny against Pat’s order. Pat,
I dare say, would have licked him until he
couldn’t tell himself from a last year’s corpse.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did you like your reception in
England?” Mark was asked during his last
visit there.</p>

<p>“Overwhelming, indescribable! There are
no other words for it,” he said, “but let me
get hold of Andy (Carnegie). His country,
Scotland, used truly fiendish means for humiliating
me, though I spent a whole day
riding across the blamed island—couldn’t do
better, for the train between Edinburgh and
London wouldn’t, or couldn’t, go slower.</p>

<p>“Well, at Edinburgh I crept into one of
those rat-cages they call railway carriage, first
class, and opened the ‘Irish Times,’ that I
bought at the station. I kidded myself, hoping
that the unfurling of that paper would promote
conversation, or trouble or something, with
fellow passengers. But there was only one,
and he got even with me in the most awful and
bloodthirsty style. Namely, he pulled out of
his valise a copy of the ‘Innocents,’ in two
volumes, and after lighting a pipe, began
reading. I watched him, first out of a corner
of my eye, then with the whole eye, then with
the pair of them. Nothing doing—that horse
thief didn’t crack a single smile over the first
two hundred and fifty pages.</p>

<p>“After luncheon—even the excellent salmon
was gall and the other thing to me—Mr.
Scotchman repeated his torture, heaping more
red-hot coals on my mane, the insides of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
hands and of my shoes—that is, he read the
second story through likewise without as much
as a squint.”</p>

<p>And Mark got up and left without another
word.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SLANG_NOT_IN_MARKS">SLANG NOT IN MARK’S
DICTIONARY</h2>
</div>


<p>Seldom or never did I hear Mark use slang—whether
he thought himself above it in the
matter of provoking laughter, or whether he
disliked it, I can’t tell. He used to keep the
Berlin or Vienna embassy, or whatever the
resort happened to be, in a roar by telling of
billiard balls “the size of walnuts” and of a
billiard table “as big as the State of Rhode
Island,” but such a word as “Biggity” never
escaped him.</p>

<p>An American “slangy” person says: “I’ll
be jiggered” or something. Mark put that
phrase differently: “<i>You</i> be damned if I didn’t
scream like a wet peacock with all his tail
feathers mussed.”</p>

<p>The ordinary run of humorists delight in
fussing about hotel bills. Mark affected to
“be mad clean through” at impositions practiced
upon him by foreigners, and clenched
both fists as he remarked: “We paid the heavy
bill, about <i>six cents</i>.”</p>

<p>If Mark had used the slang loved by the
vaudevillians he would be as widely unread in
the Scandinavian countries, in modern Greece
and in Russia as are the latter. “I never
liked riddles and jaw-breakers,” he said to a
member of the firm of Chatto and Windus in
London one day, after the gentleman “had
caught another foreign country for him,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
“but I guess cannibals and Pollacks alike love
to be surprised, and the grotesque, always
unexpected, is surprising.”</p>

<p>“During my stay in Stockholm some one
read the following from one of my books
(translated): ‘The solemn steadfastness of the
deep made the ship roll sideways.’ Great
laughter. ‘And she kicked up behind!’ At
that the house shook and rocked and quivered
with merriment and my fame was firmly
established in Sweden. If I had told the
audience that ‘Her Majesty’s dress crept
along the floor for three minutes (count ’em)
after the queen had gone,’ they would have
risen to a man and kissed me.”</p>

<p>Mark didn’t resort to profanity when he
wanted to lambaste man or measure. I once
heard him say to Mrs. Clemens: “I will write
him that ‘his mind is all caked up, that as an
idiot he is simply immeasurable.’</p>

<p>“And I will call him a snug person full of
pedantic proclivities; and further, ‘a long-eared
animal’ (and striking an attitude)—‘a
mule hostler with his pate full of axle grease.’”</p>

<p>“All right,” said gentle Mrs. Livy, “do so
by all means, but take care not to send the
letter.”</p>

<p>“Livy, dear, let me get it off my chest,”
pleaded Mark, “for ‘Hotel Normandie, Paris,’
would be just the place to date such an epistle
from. Don’t you remember the ‘Madame’s
screech’ to the effect that ‘one must expect
neither tact nor delicacy from Mark Twain?’”</p>

<p>The “Madame” referred to was Madam
Blanc, the critic of one of the chief French
reviews, already mentioned.</p>

<p>“The vagabond and adventurer, who from
crown to sole remained a gentleman” (I forget
from which magazine this is quoted) fairly
reveled “in the French Madame’s abomination
of his lowly self.”</p>

<p>Like other authors, Mark was not indifferent
to praise. I think he liked best an essay in a
Vienna review which hailed him as “the
journalist of <i>belles-lettres</i> who has made the
commonplaces literary, even as Emerson rendered
the commonplaces philosophic.” “A
French writer has accused him of denying
that there was any poetic feeling in the middle
ages,” continues the essay, “yet his Joan of
Arc is the most wonderfully lyric-dramatic
prose I can recall.”</p>

<p>“There are lots of people who know me
better than I do myself,” was Mark’s comment
on the above, and followed it up with a
yarn on life in “old Nevada,” when he rode
several miles behind a prairie schooner “because
of a red petticoat fluttering in the breeze
at the tail end.”</p>

<p>“That is, I thought it was a petticoat, but
when I caught up with the wagon on that
spent mud turtle of mine (my gee-gee went by
that poetic name) I found it was only a piece
of burlap displayed for art’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Did I curse ART?” demanded Mark,
looking around the circle.</p>

<p>We had set out to look at the rich collections
of jewels, curiosities and “other loot” (Mark’s
description) hoarded by the (late) Hapsburgs
in the immense pile called <i>Hofburg</i>, when the
author of “Joan of Arc,” then in the making,
switched me off to another room.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and dig out the Witch Hammer,”
he said. “Wonder whether they have a new
edition at the Imperial Library.”</p>

<p>I forget now which edition of that murderous
book we examined, but I do remember
some of the figures we jotted down at the
librarian’s suggestion. The Witch Hammer,
that is, a voluminous “treatise for discovering,
torturing, maiming and burning witches,”
was first published, we learned, in 1487, and
twenty-eight editions were put through the
press during the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Later Mark listened to my reading from the
Latin text with so stern a mien I suggested
that he looked like a Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p>“I pity your ignorance,” he drawled, “Torquemada
and the rest didn’t think of being
unhappy <i>re</i> those auto-da-fes, for every witch-fire
lit by their orders meant a warm jingle
in their own pockets. When they tortured an
accused person, the cost of the proceedings
was collected by the sheriff, ditto when they
burned some old lady, or a child maybe—it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
was all grist to their mill, for the Grand Inquisitor
got a rake-off on all prosecutions, and in
those good old days it cost more to break a
human being on the wheel than to feed him
and care for him in jail. The great Napoleon,
you once told me, found some three hundred
crowned leeches infesting Germany when he
started to break up their little game. What
do you suppose they lived on, those kinglets,
princes, graves and dukes—on the dog tax?
No, most of them lived on the interest of the
fortunes their ancestors had accumulated by
prosecuting and burning witches.”</p>

<p>Some years later Mark related the story of
our search for the Witch Hammer before a
motley crowd of litterateurs at Brown’s Hotel,
London. “Fine,” said Bram Stoker, “tell us
some more; I have a short story on witchcraft
in hand.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mark, “don’t forget
Henry VIII, Elizabeth and the first James.
Wife-killing Henry started the witch-burning
business in ‘merry’ England, Elizabeth revived
the sport, and the son of Mary Stuart,
whose Bible lies on every drawing-room table
at home, used both pen and axe to exterminate
witches and ‘demons.’ I read up closely on
the subject when I got down to Joan of Arc’s
trial.”</p>

<p>Some of our English friends didn’t seem
pleased with Mark’s reminiscences of British
intolerance. “What about Salem?” asked
one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Salem,” replied Mark, drawing out
the word like a rubber band, “you needn’t get
cocky about Salem. The Massachusetts
witchcraft delusion was only an echo of your
own English persecutions, and a flash in the
pan at that. I have the data in my booklet
here. Admitted we fool Americans <i>did</i> hang
twenty-two and tortured some fifty people
under the English-German-Spanish witchcraft
acts—to our shame and disgrace—compare
these figures with the records of man and
woman burnings ordered by your ‘bloody
Mary’ alone. On the very morning of the
day when the old cat died, seven or eight
Britishers were billed to be reduced to cinders
at Smithfield (where you buy your steak nowadays),
and if the devil hadn’t made room for
her Majesty in hell before noon, there would
have been so many more martyrs.”</p>

<p>He turned to Stoker. “Bram,” he said,
“the only satisfactory way to do a witchcraft
story is to filch it bodily from Balzac. The
Frenchman got the thing down to perfection
in one of his Droll yarns—I know a shop in the
Strand where you can buy a pirated edition—reproduced
by the camera—for half a
crown.”</p>

<p>“Hold,” he added, “I can give you the
recipe of the witch salve, so called. Fisher
and I dug it up at the Berlin Royal Library.
It was a compound of hemlock, mandragora,
henbane and belladonna. No wonder it set
persons, thus embalmed all over the naked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
body, crazy, tickled them to indulge in all
sorts of insane antics, that lent themselves
to devilish interpretation at a period when
every tenth person aspired to boom a religion
of his own.”</p>

<p>“I wish somebody would kick me for a
damned <i>Treppenwitz</i>,” said Mark Twain,
gazing into a bookseller’s shop window Unter
den Linden.</p>

<p>“The Herr <i>Schutzmann</i> (traffic policeman)
will oblige; just say—”</p>

<p>Mark glanced at the whiskered giant bestriding
his ill-shaped cattle at the intersection
of Friedrich Strasse.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, I won’t <i>lese majeste</i> on a
Friday,” replied Mark, “besides, I don’t like
the cop’s boot.” (In before-1918 days, you
need but say, ‘Verdammt Kaiser,’ in Berlin,
to get knocked down, arrested, and sent up
for months and months.)</p>

<p>“What’s <i>Treppenwitz</i>?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know myself until Harry Thurston
Peck told me. It’s the wisdom that comes to
you going down the stairs, or the elevator,
after making a fool of yourself higher up—an
afterthought, as it were.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the afterthought <i>now</i>?”</p>

<p>“See that book?” (pointing), “no, not that,
the yellowback, by Prof. Borkowsky—one
more guy trying to explain Jonathan Swift.
I forgot when his Deanship lived and died, but
they must have been at it for centuries. And
without examining the new volume, I bet I
can tell its contents: more highfalutin’ tommyrot
about the Dean’s vagaries in erotics and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
small beer politics. There must be a considerable
library on the subject, every new author
threshing the old straw a tenth time, and
adding mystery trimmings of his own. I
always promised myself to submit <i>my</i> theories
on Swift and his harem at a first-class insanity
shop, but I forgot to ask Krafft-Ebing in
Vienna, and now I let Virchow pass.”</p>

<p>I was going to say something obvious, but
Mark stopped me. “I know Virchow’s special
line, but that man is wise on every conceivable
subject, and I am quite sure he would have
borne me out, namely, that Swift’s character
can be explained on the theory that he was a
Sadist and a Masochist in one. If Swift, as he
wrote to an acquaintance, ‘died of rage like a
poisoned rat in a hole,’ I am sure he enjoyed
it. God knows that man gave more pain to
his lady loves, Stella, Vanessa and the rest,
than all the Romeos in Shakespeare. They
say that he killed Vanessa by frightening her
to death; he certainly murdered Stella morally
by letting her pass for his mistress. Still these
two women and others, whose names I forget,
were proud of the torments inflicted upon
them. I wish I had asked Virchow, when he
invited the audience to put questions to him
at the end of the lecture.”</p>

</div>


<p>We had lunch with some of the Herald boys
at <i>Cafe des Ambassadeurs</i>, Champs-Elysees,
when Dick Benet, editor of “Dalziel’s News,”
joined us. Dick, “contrary to his usual
morosity, acted the gay and debonair,” to
quote Clemens, who suggested that “he must
have given the boss the toothache by managing
to get his salary raised a hundred francs
per annum.”</p>

<p>There was much hilarity about that, for we
all knew “the boss” for a skinflint, and Mark
told a succession of funny stories about his
own salary grabs on the “Virginia Enterprise”
and other impecunious sheets. All
were keenly alive to the treat, only Dick
seemed absent-minded, pulling out his watch
every little while and keeping an eye on the
door.</p>

<p>“You are not afraid of a bum-bailiff <i>now</i>,”
suggested Mark.</p>

<p>“Neither now, nor at any future time,”
replied Dick. “Fact is, the wife promised to
meet me here and I have an engagement at
two o’clock which I mustn’t miss under any
circumstances whatever.” Our friend seemed
to be lying under some pressure or excitement.</p>

<p>At one-fifteen a tall, stylish Frenchwoman
entered, and Dick rushed up to her with outstretched
hands. “So glad you came in
time,” he murmured. He slurred over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
introductions, drew his wife on to the seat
next to him, and whispered to her.</p>

<p>At fifteen minutes to two (we adduced the
figures later by comparing notes) two strangers
in high silk toppers walked up to Dick, saying:
“It’s time, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>Dick nodded, rose, bent over his wife and
kissed her on the mouth. Then he shook
hands all around, and with some more adieux
walked away with his friends. We saw him
seated in a cabriolet, then leave it abruptly.</p>

<p>“Victoire, my love, I am so sorry,” he said,
rushing back and covering his wife’s face with
kisses—“so sorry to leave you.”</p>

<p>One more lingering kiss and he was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Half an hour later Mark and I passed by
Dalziel’s News Bureau, as a man came out of
the counting room to paste up “the latest.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see what it is,” said Mark. “Maybe
King Leopold is dead, and I mustn’t miss
putting on court mourning for HIM.” This
is what we read on the bulletin-board:</p>

<p>“Monsieur Richard Benet, the editor of
Dalziel’s, was killed in a duel with —— at
2:15 this afternoon. <i>R. I. P.</i>”</p>

<p>Mark was visibly affected. “That poor
woman,” he kept saying; “a stroke out of
the blue. But Dick felt that he was taking
leave of her for good; that accounts for his
repeated: ‘I’m so sorry.’” And much more
to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>To get Clemens’ mind off the melancholy
affair, I suggested “Swithin.”</p>

<p>“Done,” said Mark, “and we will take him
out to supper, for I bet he hasn’t got a sou
marquis in his jeans.”</p>

<p>“Swithin” was Mark’s pet name for a
Franco-American writer whose real name happened
to recall the legend of a Saint, a groundhog,
and several kinds of weather.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the heat had taken on a Sahara
hue. “It seems to me we are not walking,
we are <i>dripping</i>,” remarked Clemens, as we
climbed the four stairs to the studio. We had
been told to walk right in, and we did, accidentally
upsetting the screen that separated
the anteroom from the office.</p>

<p>Tableau! Here was “Swithin” and his
secretary, the one dictating, the other thumping
the typewriter and both—stark naked.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” broke in Mark. “<i>Puris
naturalibus</i> is the only way to face this hellish
temperature—a white man’s solitary chance
to get even with civilization! If there were a
bathtub, a few banana trees and a fire-spitting
mountain around, I would think myself in the
Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>“Talking of sandwiches,” he added, “hustle
into your tailor-mades and come out for a bite.
You must be fearfully hungry—working on a
day like this?”</p>

<p>“Swithin” didn’t have to be told twice. He
dashed into the adjoining room for his clothes,
but returned after a little while, still <i>en nature</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and swearing like the whole Flanders army.
He searched presses, drawers, nooks and corners
with hands and eyes.</p>

<p>“Anything missing?” mocked Mark.</p>

<p>“Only my duds—I bet those confounded
roommates of mine—(followed a string of
epithets that wouldn’t look well in print)
stole and pawned them, for they had neither
cigarette nor lunch money this morning.”</p>

<p>“Come to think,” put in the secretary, “I
saw Monsieur Hector leave with a bundle.”</p>

<p>“My jeans, coat and vest,” shrieked
“Swithin,” tearing his hair, while Mark
writhed with laughter.</p>

<p>“And there were fifteen or twenty sous in an
inside pocket besides,” moaned “Swithin.”</p>

<p>“I know Monsieur Hector’s hang-out,”
said the secretary, “and if you like I will go
and choke the pawn tickets out of the pair.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t do better if you tried,” opined
Mark, “for no doubt by this time they have
devoured the proceeds of their brigandage.
Hurry, before they sell the tickets.”</p>

<p>We found Hector and his brother-bandit
behind a magnum of fake champagne, gourmandizing
at the Dead Cat, a newly opened
restaurant destined to become famous in
Bohemia.</p>

<p>“Sure,” they said, “we <i>borrowed</i> old Swithin’s
old clothes, but expected to bring them
back before seven. We are now waiting for the
angel who promised to relieve our financial
distress, which is only momentary, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>They gave up the tickets willingly enough,
and we repaired to <i>Mont de Piété</i> in Rue Lepic.</p>

<p>“Mountain of Pity—a queer name for a
hock shop,” said Mark when I related the
redemption of Swithin’s clothes. “I once
knew a three-hundred-pound Isaac in ’Frisco,
but that is another story.”</p>

<p>We had been talking about changing one’s
luck at the Eccentric Club, London, and Mark
said: “All is personal effort, there is no
such thing as anything interfering for one’s
advantage or the opposite.”</p>

<p>“Guess you are about right,” said Stoker.
“There was Loie Fuller, an indifferent soubrette
before she became the goddess of beauty
and chained Anatole France and the rest to
her chariot. I remember meeting her one
afternoon in the Strand, looking for a cable
office. Only a few hours previous I had heard
that poor Loie was on her uppers, her manager
having cheated her, leaving her penniless in
Berlin. And, worse luck, I didn’t know a
thing she could do in London, or even the
provinces, just then. That, you can imagine,
made me feel quite gawky.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had a right to be a sob sister,”
interpolated Mark.</p>

<p>“She didn’t give me the chance, not she,”
emphasized Bram, “for, grabbing me by the
arm, with tears rolling down her cheeks, she
whispered in a choked voice: ‘Father is dead,
Father is dead! Lend me ten shillings to cable
to New York, please.’ She added: ‘Poor
Father. But now I <i>will</i> succeed, <i>I swear it,
Father</i>.’</p>

<p>“And two or three weeks later she created
the serpentine dance, earning such blurbs as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
‘the chastest and most expressive of dancers,
who restored to us the lost wonders of Greek
mimicry.’”</p>

<p>“I hear she is about to open her own theatre
in Paris now,” announced the Standard critic.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff,” said Mark. “Loie, like
myself—both red-headed—knew that ambition
is a horse that more than one can ride.
I grabbed that idea ’way back in the seventies
when Artemus Ward came down lecturing
Virginia way. Art was a success and I liked
the lordly nonchalance with which he spent
two or three hundred dollars on a tear. I
helped him spend plenty, I assure you, but
when Art and the brown taste in my mouth
had gone, I took stock.</p>

<p>“‘Sam,’ I said to myself, quite familiar-like,
‘Sam, your mental adipose is as good as
his, and in originality you can beat him dead.’</p>

<p>“After these encouraging remarks, I set to
work making good,” concluded Mark.</p>

<p>Mark conquered Germany before he became
one of the favorite literary sons of Austria.
“I often wonder that they take to my brand
of humor so well,” he told me more than once
in Vienna—“I mean AFTER MY GERMAN
TRIUMPHS, for if Vienna Bookland hates
anything worse than German Bookland, I
haven’t come across the likes of it. Each
capital thinks itself a Boston and each
calls the other Kalamazoo, or dead Indian
Town.</p>

<p>“But I’m not ungrateful,” continued Mark,
“and to prove it, I studied hard and established
the identity of the fatherlandish author
whom both Vienna and Berlin admired
(though nobody reads him, of course):
Goethe.”</p>

<p>“Goethe was Englished before I tackled
him, but I happened on a passage in Faust
that, it seemed to me, was not done justice to.
So I summoned the family to a powwow and
between us, and a heap of dictionaries, we
rendered the disputed and immortal lines
‘thus classic’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘What hypocrites and such can’t do without—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cheese it—ne’er mention it aloud.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Bayard” (Taylor) “would have burst with
envy if he had lived long enough to see how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
happily I interpreted Goethe without itching
for translator’s laurels or royalties.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see the original, Mark.”</p>

<p>“Here it is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Man darf es nicht vor keuschen Ohren nennen,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“<i>Vers libre</i> with a vengeance, eh?” chuckled
Mark. “And why in thunder shouldn’t that
mean verse liberally handled?”</p>

<p>“If I translated your version of Goethe back
into German, do you suppose the Fatherlanders
would understand it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said honest Mark, “but I do understand
<i>their</i> translations of <i>my</i> lingo—I am told
they make me appear like a native German
writer, in fact Moritz Busch called me the
most translatable of foreign authors, to my
face—but Goethe was a poet, and a prose man,
like me, can never do justice to a poetry man
of Goethe’s distinction. Look at these German
translations of Shakespeare—they think
them classic—they get my eyes in flood with
laughter.”</p>

<p>On another page I have jotted down some
sayings of Mark’s relating why he “steadfastly
refused” to bull the French and Italian
literary markets. That in England it was
different, goes without saying, and George
Moore once explained Mark’s English popularity
to me.</p>

<p>“It’s his peculiar power of presenting pathetic
situations without slush,” insisted “the
last Victorian” in his manner of finality.</p>

<p>Mark was visibly tickled when I read the
Moore estimate from the cuff on which I had
jotted it down.</p>

<p>He pondered a short while on “the adjectives,”
then drawled slowly: “The English
are good sports, you know.”</p>

<p>Here are a few more opinions of English
men of letters which I gathered off and on.</p>

<p>Davison Dalziel, M. P., editor of “The
Standard,” London: “I agree with ‘The
Spectator’ that Mark Twain is the most popular
writer in the English tongue because he
added more plentifully and more generously
to the gayety of the empire of our language
than any other author, living or dead.”</p>

<p>Moberly Bell, late editor of “The Times,”
London (in winter of 1899): “Mark Twain
succeeded with us because he is a fearless
upholder of all that is clean, honest, noble and
straightforward in letters as well as in life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
He once told me that he ‘qualified as the first
yellow journalist.’ I wish to God he had remained
the first and only one.”</p>

<p>That was before Mr. Bell negotiated for the
sale of “The Times” to Lord Northcliffe.</p>

<p>William Heinemann, the late famous London
publisher, who could never get hold of any
of Mark Twain’s books for publication:</p>

<p>“An author as well beloved as he is popular
and famous. Wit, scholar, orator, millionaire
perhaps” (that was before the Webster period),
“yet I have seen a letter of his in which he
stated point blank: ‘I would rather be a pilot
than anything else in the world,’ and that
letter was penned after two hundred thousand
copies of ‘Innocents Abroad’ had been sold.”</p>

<p>“And how did you like the King of Sweden?”
I heard Lord Roberts ask Clemens at
the Army and Navy Club, one afternoon.</p>

<p>“Well, frankly, if I must suffer myself to
have intercourse with kings, I prefer the
Prince of Wales,” replied Mark.</p>

<p>Then somebody told a story about the
Swedish Majesty’s last sojourn in Norway.
There, at a railway station, Oscar ran against
a crusty old farmer who thought himself a lot
better than a mere king and kept his hat on.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know enough to bare your head
in the presence of the King?” demanded
Oscar.</p>

<p>“You bare your head and I’ll bare mine,”
replied the farmer. “My family has been here
a great many hundred years longer than
yours.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Oscar got so enraged he knocked
the farmer’s hat off with a sweep of his cane
and if bystanders hadn’t interfered the King
would have been pummeled “handsome”
then and there.</p>

<p>“I am glad I doffed my hat before Oscar
came in,” said Mark.</p>

</div>


<p>“This here earth is governed like a military
despoty,” said Mark Twain when we were
sitting outside a Ringstrasse restaurant in
Vienna one afternoon. He was eyeing the
procession of army officers, with pretty girls
upon their arms, passing to and fro.</p>

<p>“And if you had the ordering of things,
would your soul have meandered into one of
these jackanapes in monkey jackets and corsets,
and czackos and busbies and things?”
inquired Susan, the wit’s witty young
daughter.</p>

<p>“No, darling, but I would have loved to
live in the time of Shakespeare and Queen
Elizabeth, the best dressed period of the world.
You know I like color and flummery and all
such things—I was born red-headed—maybe
that accounts for my passion for the gorgeous
and ornamental.”</p>

<p>“Tell the company about the riot of colors
you delight in,” said Susan.</p>

<p>“I saw it only once,” replied Mark, “and it
was rather uncomfortable, even painful, to the
other creature, namely, a tortoise-shell cat
that accidentally had dropped into a tomato
stew. As pussy tried to get out, pawing like
the baby after the Ivory soap, there was a
display of rainbows, spectrums, chromatics,
prisms, pigments, and plain everyday paints
and stains such as I have run across in a few
Italian picture galleries only.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>He picked up a copy of the “New York
Herald,” lying on the table. “There’s our
friend George in New York,” he said, “having
more trouble with that pesky French brother-in-law
of his. The little Paris fortune hunter
has already cost his wife’s estate fifteen or
twenty million francs and—no returns outside
of a few babies. Yet French brother-in-law
could make a tall income if he were put to
‘work right,’ as they say in the wild and
woolly, for he has a most tremendous eye for
color effects, that chap. If he were my brother-in-law,
I would starve the cuss into becoming
a man-milliner, the first of the world.
That’s what he could be, and ought to be with
clever management.</p>

<p>“My word,” continued Mark, “you ought
to see him drive in state in the Bois de Boulogne.
When I first clapped eyes on his
flunkies and outriders, in their liveries, rich
yet soft in color effects, I almost yearned to be
one of them for the sake of their fine togs.”</p>

<p>Indeed, sensational clothes were always
Mark’s hobby. Hence the white suits he
wore in his reclining days, and the sealskin
coat, with the fur outside, that adorned him
in his days of youthful glory. I am quite
sure he would have gone to bed in his Oxford
mantle and cap if he had had more than one
of each, and the passing of his red hair was a
real grievance to him, he told Gyp, the French
novelist whom he called, “warm, yet not
torrid.”</p>

came out of the Metropole Hotel in Paris as
we passed.</p>

Cleo de Merode.”</p>

Mark.</p>

<p>“Get-up?” I repeated. “Kings always
wear frayed jeans when they travel incog.”</p>

<p>“In that case, go and smash the old beast.
You are younger than I, and heavier, too.”</p>

<p>At the moment when Mark extended this
thoughtful invitation, Swithins of the “New
York Herald” hailed us. “Look at that
chap,” he said, pointing to the person I had
called his Belgian Majesty; “he is the model
who sat for L’Assiette au Beurre’s caricature
of King Leopold as Saint Anthony. Let’s go
inside and get a copy.”</p>

<p>Mark bought a dozen or more to send to
American friends. The caricature by D’Ostoya,
if I recollect rightly, was an excellent
likeness of both the King and of the beggar
we had run across.</p>

<p>“Neither would take his hat off to Rothschild,”
said Mark; “Leopold, because his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Congo savageries had made him enormously
rich, the beggar because he wouldn’t know the
richest man from a mere million-pauper, like
me.”</p>

<p>D’Ostoya’s cartoon represented Leopold
in monk’s habit, undergoing one of the several
temptations immortalized by Flaubert’s great
novel. But it wasn’t the Queen of Sheba who
called—rather Mrs. Fat-and-Forty minus furbelows
and things. No wonder Leopold,
being artistically inclined, looks annoyed.</p>

<p>“Watch the virtuous indignation oozing
out of the old rascal,” said Mark. “The editor
of the ‘Ladies’ Home Journal,’ asked to do
an essay on bruisers for the ‘Police Gazette,’
couldn’t be shocked any harder.”</p>

<p>When I told him about an article on Leopold
I had done for the “New York World,” which
caused a Montreal editor, who stole it, to be
jugged for libel (“Six months,” said the judge
of literature), Mark grew enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Was that yours?” he cried. “Good boy!
Come along and I will buy you dinner at one
of those places where they are ashamed to
put the price of dishes à la carte because they
hate to confess that they charge less than
1,000 francs a pea.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIZING_UP_OF_ARISTOCRACY">SIZING UP OF ARISTOCRACY
BY MARK</h2>
</div>


<p>At one of the many splendid dinner parties
at the house of Minister Walter Phelps, the
strange case of Prince and Princess XXX of a
once sovereign family had come in for a lot of
discussion. Their highnesses stood convicted
of hotel looting, yet on account of the imaginary
coronet that topped their escutcheon,
they were expected to go scot-free, “for everybody
agreed that her ‘Grace’ was plainly a
kleptomaniac.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so, Mr. Clemens?” demanded
an old countess, coquetting with the
last tooth in her mouth.</p>

<p>“I am no expert,” replied Mark. “All I
know is that the disease attacks only the high
born, as you call them, and the well-to-do.”</p>

<p>As on this occasion all of Mr. Phelps’ native
guests were more or less “high born,” and
impecunious, that remark of the Sage of a
Hundred Stories put the quietus on aristocracy-propaganda
during the rest of the dinner
and later, in the smoking room, Mr. Phelps’
American guests were left quite to themselves.</p>

<p>“I hope I wasn’t rude to that blue-blooded
one,” said Mark, “but excusing thievery because
the thief happens to have a handle to his
or her name, gets my goat on the instant.
Now” (looking at me) “give us the real story
of that looting business by High Lifers, so we
can discuss it intelligently. Its general gist I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
got from the German papers, but lack details.”</p>

<p>I gave the latter as follows: The Prince XXX
was a second son, consequently always hard
up. The Princess had no money of her own
either, but in place of that a soaring ambition.
Food positively disagreed with her every time
she took it off mere china or stoneware. She
must have silver—</p>

<p>“Or bust—” said Mark. “I made out that
much.”</p>

<p>Well, to get the plate and plenty of it, their
highnesses engaged in a coaching tour of the
Fatherland, stopping nightly at a different
hotel. And at each hostelry her Grace swiped
all the silver she could carry off, milk jugs,
souvenir spoons and forks and dish covers,
napkin rings and similar knicknacks.</p>

<p>“And these swipings she sent to her ancestral
halls, Castle Teufelsdroekh,” added Mark,
“where, under the skillful stylus of an engraver,
the low hotel markings disappeared
to make room for the princely coat-of-arms.
But here’s the pretty how-do-you-do about
the scapegoat:</p>

<p>“A servant caught her Grace at the game
and gave information to the police. The
police promptly arrested the informant as a
material witness and submitted to their highnesses
that, at some future date, they might
graciously deign to appear in court to answer
the wretch’s foul insinuations.”</p>

<p>Followed a lengthy discussion, embroidered
with execrating reflections on justice as handled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
in the Fatherland, Mark quite surpassing
himself in juicy invectives. After a while
other subjects came up, and Clemens retired
to a desk in the corner and began writing
furiously on the backs of stray envelopes he
fished from the wastebasket. He scribbled
and scratched for about ten minutes, then got
up and read us the following:</p>

<p>Mark called at the “New York Herald”
office in London one day when a cable came
over the wire, describing the awful punishment
visited by the Czar (Alexander) on the mistress
of one of the Grand Dukes. The lady
had been ambushed, carried off to a hairdressing
establishment during the dark hours
of the night and there robbed of her abundant
locks. In fact, her head was shaved à la billiard
ball.</p>

<p>“Very ingenious,” mused Mark, “for who
would, or could, love a bald-headed woman?
They do things neatly in Russia, anyhow. I
remember a devilish joke the great Catharine
played on a rival. She had her yanked out of
a quadrille, muzzled, and spirited into the
basement. There she was whipped good and
hard with switches soaked twelve hours in
vinegar and salt. Then back to the ballroom
and ‘dance, you hussy, and smile, or you get
another dose.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WHEN_A_PUBLISHER_DINES_AND">WHEN A PUBLISHER DINES AND
WINES YOU</h2>
</div>


<p>Mark, unlike many authors, was always on
excellent terms with his publishers. He always
had a good word for the Harpers, particularly
“the scholarly Henry J.” (since dead), Chatto
and Windus, George Harvey, Baron Tauchnitz
and the rest, but James R. Osgood of
Boston (later of London) he loved.</p>

<p>“You lucky dog,” he said to me during my
first visit to the “sausage room,” at the Hotel
Royal, Berlin. “To pal up with Osgood is a
stroke of good luck that you hardly deserve.
Why—” (speaking very slowly, as if hunting
for words), “Osgood is that rara avis among
publishers who will invite you to lunch or
dinner or to a box at the Gaiety without
tampering in the least with your royalty
accounts.</p>

<p>“It isn’t always thus in the ‘profesh,’ you
know. Speaking of <i>the</i> profesh in particular,
there was Jimmy Powers in New York, a rising
comedian, indeed rising very rapidly. He had
jumped from 200 a week to 500, when a new
managerial aspirant came along, and offered
him a tremendous raise, a sort of Chimborazo
article, it was to be.</p>

<p>“Jimmy cottoned to the man’s palaver like
a donkey scenting a barrel full of nice, juicy
thistles, a pincushion perfecto, each one, and
promised to go eating with him, a great concession
on his part, for Jimmy had lost his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
appetite, found a boa constrictor’s, and was
ashamed of his big, lumbering appetite.</p>

<p>“Well, they rendezvoused at old Martin’s on
Tenth Street and Fifth Avenue, then the most
<i>recherché</i> meal joint in town. It happened, by
the way, at the period when the deadly table
d’hote imposition was just beginning to
sprout.</p>

<p>“Jimmy had never faced that sort of jaw
music and knew no more about ‘<i>entrees</i>,’
‘<i>poisson</i>,’ ‘<i>legumes</i>,’ etc., than the average
Irish waiter’s wife. Up to then his dinner had
consisted invariably of steak, murphies and
pie—the embarrassment of courses described
in more or less pigeon-French on the Martin
menu, therefore, bewildered and frightened
him. When he heard the new manager say
over the anchovies, cold slaw and pickled sardines:
‘Well, Jimmy, how would a thousand
a week suit you?’ Powers had only strength
to ejaculate: ‘The Lord preserve us!’</p>

<p>“The fried ‘English’ sole de-Long-Branch
with drawn butter and capers on the side was
so delicious, Jimmy didn’t perceive the slight
discrepancy in figures when the manager repeated
the question in this fashion: ‘How
would you like to draw a cool nine hundred a
week, Jimmy?’</p>

<p>“‘It’s done,’ said Jimmy, attacking his
third tumbler of red ink. ‘I can keep a hoss
on that, can’t I?’</p>

<p>“‘And marry Lillian Russell—what a team
you two would make,’ seconded the manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Well, to cut a long story short, that rascally
manager did the boy out of a hundred
with every succeeding course, and when finally
he pulled a fountain pen on him, Jimmy signed
his laughter-provoking powers away for five
hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.
Subtract five-twenty-five from a thousand
and you will find that Jimmy’s one dollar meal
netted the manager exactly $24,700 per
annum. Neat piece of work, eh?”</p>

<p>Mark’s admiration for the fair-dealing Osgood
was reflected in his own treatment of
General Grant. He not only paid Grant
double the royalties a rival publisher had offered,
but actually wrote out to Grant the
largest check any author ever received from
a publishing house up to that time.</p>

<p>Yet in the numerous discussions of royalties,
authorship and the publishing business which
he conducted in my hearing, he never mentioned
the generosity he had displayed towards
the old boy. Poetry was Mark’s weakness,
or rather his ambition to dabble in poetry
was; he had no other small vices to shock his
friends.</p>

<p>The chief regret of Mark’s literary life was
that “folks felt disappointed unless tickled”
by his writings. Joan of Arc was his first serious
attempt, but when he entered national and
New York City politics—against Blaine and
Tammany respectively—he was so much in
earnest they had to hire Bob Davis to follow
up his speeches with a few funny remarks.</p>

<p>“Throwing acorns before the swine,” Mark
called it. (“Acorn” was the name of the anti-Tammany
organization). “Bob had better
can that stuff and sell it to the Saturday Evening
Post. They will fall for it, all right.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARK_ON_ROYAL_HONORS">MARK ON “ROYAL HONORS”</h2>
</div>


<p>Mark and I were walking down the Linden,
Berlin, when a royal carriage, easily distinguished
for its well-known breed of horses and
livery, passed us. When it drew near the
“Foot Guards,” a drum and fife corps and
half a hundred soldiers, under a lieutenant,
rushed out, stood at attention and made a
frightful racket.</p>

<p>Mark remained glued to the spot at the first
sound of the “royalist propaganda”—his description—and
eyed the spectacle with a mixture
of amazement and disgust written all
over his genial face.</p>

<p>“That carriage was <i>empty</i>,” he observed,
after a lot of staring and pulling at his moustache.</p>

<p>“What’s the difference? If it were full of
princes there would be a void—somewhere,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully,” said Mark, impatiently.
“<i>I</i> was once greeted by fife and drums and
thought it the most tremendous honor ever
paid to a writing person. And now I see they
do as much for an empty carriage, when there
is a coat of arms on the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got so inflated with the reverse of
modesty when the boys in red were tickling
the veal-skin for me and worked their merry
flutes, I well nigh bust off the buttons of my
Prince Albert. It happened in Ottawa when
I was visiting the Governor General, the Marquis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
of Lorne, and come to think of it, I was
riding in one of Lorne’s carriages. When we
neared the Government House, the guards
tumbled out like mad, the drummer boys
worked like windmills in a gale and the fifes
like steam calliopes. Sure, I felt like a hundred
and fifteen degrees in the shade and I must
have walked into the hall with the strut of
Larry Barrett playing the Ghost in Hamlet.
It was the proudest moment of my life
then—and now I see it was all bosh and
balderdash.”</p>

<p>Speaking of those Canadian days, Mark
vehemently rebuked me when I suggested
that the Marquis of Lorne was “a prosy
ass.”</p>

<p>“But I admit it’s embarrassing to visit in a
family where the head of the house is a mere
Lord, while the wife is kowtowed to as her
Royal Highness. Mixes one up so, and I
think that in my perplexity I once or twice
said a Lord too many, namely, ‘Oh Lord, Oh
Lord.’ I never was boss in my own house,
but I like other men to be the he-brute for fair.
At Ottawa I recalled a hundred times Lola
Montez, the girl who started the revolution
in Munich by wearing the breeches at the
Palace.</p>

<p>“‘I am the master here,’ shouted King
Louis, during one of their rows.</p>

<p>“‘And I am the <i>mistress</i>, don’t you forget
that,’ replied Lola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“Now, Lola was only a common baggage,
strolling actor-folks’ bairn,” added Mark.
“Think of the advantages royal birth gives to
a woman. Such a one, even if born without
legs, would wear the breeches and boss the
show.”</p>

<p>In another place I have recorded Mark’s
high opinion of the beauty of the Vienna
women and of the lack of beauty he encountered
at the Berlin court.</p>

<p>As we were walking home from a reception
given by Mr. and Mrs. John Jackson (John
Jackson, of New Jersey, first secretary of the
Berlin Legation) Mark said: “It’s like looking
up at the Horse Shoe in the Metropolitan
Opera House to see those pretty American
girls, Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Bingham (wife of
Captain, later General Bingham) and Marion
Phelps (daughter of Minister William Walter
Phelps). Marion is blonde and inclined to be
statuesque, like the native women here, but
oh, the difference! As in the case of Mrs.
Jackson and Mrs. Bingham, one sees at a
glance that Nature squandered more refinement
on her than on a thousand Berlin women,
royal and otherwise.</p>

<p>“They say God made man in his effigy. I
don’t know about that, but I’m quite sure
that he put a lot of divinity into the American
girl.”</p>

<p>The woman behind the counter looked at
him inquiringly. “New paper, Sir? Never
heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of Tay Pay? How long have
<i>you</i> been in the business?” asked Mark.</p>

<p>“Ever since I was thirteen, and I’m past
sixty now.”</p>

<p>Mark shook his head and started to walk
away, when he saw a copy of the paper nailed
up on the outside. “I knew you were mistaken,”
he said to the woman. “There is the
paper I want. See the title: ‘Tay Pay,’ as
large as life.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the newswoman. “We

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MAN_WHO_DIDNT_GET_USED">THE MAN WHO DIDN’T GET USED
TO HANGING</h2>
</div>


<p>At the Eccentric Club somebody said:
“Man gets used to everything except hanging,”
when Mark interrupted him: “Hold,”
he drawled. “When I was last in London”
(this was in 1907) “one of the ‘Savages’ related
a yarn to me which flatly contradicts
your commonplace idea.</p>

<p>“The incident happened in the good old
hanging days, when all London, Glasgow,
Brighton, or Edinburgh, etc., turned out before
breakfast to see some poor devil dance on
air. Henry VIII had two hundred thousand
‘sturdy beggars’ put to death, besides his
several wives; I don’t remember now the London
average per week or day, but while hanging
continued a public amusement it had long
ceased being a ‘first-page story’ as far as the
metropolitan dailies were concerned.</p>

<p>“Indeed, the papers disdained to send their
‘own correspondents’ or reporters to such
small-fry events as the taking of a man’s or,
perchance, a woman’s life in public, and entrusted
that part of the daily grind to a
‘flimsy man,’ who sent duplicate copies to all
the papers, morning and evening. The ‘flimsy
man,’ of course, got so used to the dope and to
the eternal sameness of the thing, he could
dictate a first-rate hanging yarn without
leaving his office, or using the phone—beg
pardon, there were no phones in those days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Well, one Monday morning, at sunrise, a
certain ‘Knight of the Road’ was to die by a
tight cravat in a town less than fifty miles
from London, and the ‘flimsy man’ thought
it would hardly pay to go up (or down) and
impersonate the eyewitness. Besides, he
knew the governor of the jail personally; his
Lordship was an obliging man and would
gladly assist at a fake.</p>

<p>“So Mr. Flimsy wrote out his story and
held it ‘for release.’</p>

<p>“In the meantime, the doomed man went
through the usual rigmarole: prayers, whiskey,
breakfast, more whiskey—march to the gallows.
He found an audience of prize-fight
size awaiting him. The prison yard was black
with people, all the surrounding roofs, trees
and telegraph poles were alive with spectators,
and many poor chaps who had stood all night
in line for their betters, now sold standing
room at a premium.</p>

<p>“Officialdom, too, was well represented:
the governor of the jail, his aides and assistants,
the chief of police in their Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes, and lots of bobbies” (cops)
“—every mother’s son and daughter eager for
the hanging, and secretly hoping that no reprieve
would spoil the day’s fun, for somehow
the story had got abroad that the Home Secretary
had almost decided to commute the
death sentence of this particular party.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, preparations proceeded at an
encouraging rate: there was the procession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
headed by the gentlemanly hangman, swinging
a rope; then bobbies, jailers, trusties. The
doomed man walked rather jauntily at the
side of the parson, who was mumbling prayers
and looking benign.</p>

<p>“Presently the procession stood under the
gallows, all necks craned, and a hush fell upon
the expectant crowd as the hangman’s assistant
pulled the linen cap down over his victim’s
face. As he got busy adjusting the noose,
shouts of ‘reprieve!’ ‘reprieve!’ went up. The
hangman looked at the governor and the governor
turned towards the gate, which had
opened to admit a small messenger boy from
the telegraph office.</p>

<p>“The boy was waving a yellow envelope
over his head, and the governor signalled to
the hangman to wait.</p>

<p>“At the same time the telegraph boy was
hoisted over the shoulders of the crowd until
he reached the place where the governor
stood. As the governor received and opened
the dispatch, there were more hoarse cries of
‘reprieve!’ and they were not cries of relief or
triumph either. Sure, the crowd thought
itself cheated. The men and women and
children (for there were plenty of children, as
usual) thought that they had bet on a horse
that didn’t run—a dead horse that wasn’t
dead enough, so to speak!</p>

<p>“But, presto! another change. The governor,
having glanced at the message, made a
wry face, then crumpled the paper up in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
hand and threw it on the ground, while he
motioned the hangman to proceed.</p>

<p>“The wire was from the aforementioned
fakir and it read: ‘Please wire (prepaid)
whether hanging has come off according to
program—Jack.’ But that’s neither here nor
there. The point is that the man about to
be put to the worst use one can possibly put a
living person to, was allowed to think for
several minutes that the Home Secretary
had commuted his sentence of death, that
he, the doomed one, was going to live after
all. I am told they actually stripped the
cap off his face, so he could breathe freely.</p>

<p>“Had that chap got used to hanging, or
the hanging idea, by the time when the cord
was once more drawn tight? Did he think
with the French wag (or was it an Englishman?)
‘hang me, your Highness? No, that
would be the death of me.’</p>

<p>“So in our case; no, a thousand times no,
for in the interval the poor soul had got used
to <i>living</i> once more, and a thousand-and-one
murderous thoughts were in his heart while
he was being swung off into eternity.”</p>

IN CHICAGO</h2>
</div>


<p>We had been fellow coffee-drinkers and
fellow pie-eaters in Chicago since the early
eighties, at a time when beefsteak, fried
potatoes, apple pie and cheese constituted an
American table d’hote and whiskey was the
beverage for Man. Women never touched
it in those days, and American wines were so
little esteemed, that a bottle was given away
free, gratis and for nothing to each guest at
Palmer House dinners.</p>

<p>Mike McDonald was king of Chicago,
Luther Laflin Mills was State’s Attorney and
Carter Harrison was Mayor time and again.
All the newspaper men borrowed money from
Mike and drank at the expense of Luther
Laflin when he ran for office.</p>

<p>Eugene Field, of course, was the Sharps
and Flats man of the widely circulated
Daily News: I was a writer on foreign
affairs for the Chicago Times, the paper
“that would set the town by the ears daily
or burst.” The Times office was diagonally
across from the News office, and from the
News office we turned to the left into Randolph
Street, where the general hang-out,
Henrici’s, was situated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Philip Henrici, the owner of the restaurant,
had started life as a journeyman baker, and
was a Socialist or near-Socialist. He would
gladly extend credit to any writer who talked
Karl Marx to him. So Gene and I, towards
the end of each week, when there was hardly
enough money left for car fare—ourselves
had passes, but the women needed coin—talked
socialism by the ream, according to
the extent of our appetite, asserting loudly
that “Property was Theft,” one of Gene’s
bright ideas, purloined, I suppose.</p>

<p>Gene’s palate addressed itself almost exclusively
to pies and coffee and that worked
his undoing in the end. For Henrici’s coffee
was stewing all day, which made it no healthy
drink, and they served a big chunk of cheese
with every ten-cent parcel of pie—a diet
that would have given indigestion to an
ostrich in the long run.</p>

<p>And Gene’s stomach was “as touchy as his
bank account,” he used to say.</p>

<p>I said good-by to him in January, 1888.</p>

<p>“First thing you do when you strike London,
get me a job there,” he said. “The pay
envelope in this here town is too small for
words, let alone a man with a growing family.
If I once get into London and establish a reputation
there, I can lay down the law to Lawson
(publisher of the News) and squeeze this bunch
here as they have been squeezing me.”</p>

<p>That wasn’t meant as viciously as it
sounded. The News paid as well, or a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
better, than the other Chicago papers, but
the Chicago newspaper man that made from
forty to fifty dollars a week was a crackerjack-first-rater
in those days.</p>

<p>One trouble with Eugene Field was that,
at his office, he devoted too much time to
practical jokes, private versifying and general
tomfoolery. So when he had to do his
column, his fagged brain needed the stimulant
of coffee or whiskey, or he thought it
did. And black coffee was usually sent for
across the street. Moreover, he was very
fond of the theatre and wasted much time
chatting behind the scenes, in the auditorium
and with the managers in front. In
short, he could have done much more work
than he did, but it’s doubtful whether that
would have increased his compensation, which
was as high as the paper thought it could
afford—i. e., as low as could in decency be
offered to a man with Field’s following.</p>

<p>In New York, I heard of Eugene’s health-troubles
off and on, but thought little of
these reports since I had never known him
otherwise than active and laughing at the
ills human flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>If I had known, or suspected, that Eugene
had a tendency to lung trouble, I would
have written to Mrs. Field warning her
against the British climate in winter time,
for I had lived in London during several
winters and knew what rain and sleet and
fog meant there, while Gene’s Chicago friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
had not the slightest notion of English
weather conditions.</p>

<p>In 1889 I had been in Paris for a couple of
weeks, helping to establish an English news
service there, when Davison Dalziel, afterwards
British M. P., but in our Chicago
days editor of the News Letter there, told
me that Eugene Field had come to London
with his family and meant to set the Thames
on fire with his jokes and verses.</p>

<p>“He lives at 20 Alfred Street, Bedford
Square,” said Davison Dalziel, “and doesn’t
live well, I am afraid. Three boys, a wife
and a female relative into the bargain—it’s
too much for one poor pencil-pusher, a
stranger to London ways.”</p>

<p>To show how Gene was forever hampered
by the lack of funds, it is only necessary to
point out that his salary was paid over to
Mrs. Field week after week, and that Gene
had the time of his life persuading the cashier
to let him have a few dollars in advance.
I don’t know whether the News sent Gene’s
salary to Mrs. Field while they were in London.
At any rate, what Gene got out of it
was entirely inadequate and he had no chance
to add to his salary in England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MORE_OF_EUGENE_FIELDS_TRIALS">MORE OF EUGENE FIELD’S TRIALS
IN LONDON</h2>
</div>


<p>When I saw Gene in London about November,
or the end of October, 1889, his enthusiasm
for life in highbrow Grubb Street was
already on the wane. Funds were low, so
were his spirits, and the hopes he had set on
James Gordon Bennett’s enterprise had come
to naught.</p>

<p>Mr. Bennett had been running the—or a—New
York Herald in London for some time,
kidding himself that London would accept a
daily with so incongruous a title as a rival to
the Morning Post, Daily Telegraph and so
forth. And Eugene Field tried to persuade
Bennett’s representative, that it could be
done <i>provided</i> that he had a column or a
column and a half on the editorial page. His
London Sharps and Flats were to be syndicated
in America, the Chicago Daily News
having the preference. And Gene hoped to
get at least two hundred and fifty dollars a
week out of the enterprise.</p>

<p>If he only had the money to go to Paris
and stay there long enough to plead with
James Gordon in person! But James Gordon,
already a middle-aged man, continued to
play the young buck and was seldom in his
office for two consecutive days.</p>

<p>At one time, when Eugene had a hundred
dollars laid aside for Paris, he received word,
just in the nick of time, that the “Commodore”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
was off on his yacht for Monte Carlo,
and would probably stay there—“until they
kick him out,” snapped Eugene savagely.
“I hope they do.”</p>

<p>And a week later he was much elated
because they had done so. At the Eccentric
Club he let the yarn loose before an audience
dying with laughter.</p>

<p>“My unwilling Chief,” he began, “James
Gordon, I mean, went to the Casino in Monte
Carlo in a high state of intoxication, and
raised Hades with all the trimmings imaginable,
until thrown out. Then, still yelling
for ‘the frog-eaters’’ blood and Monsieur
Blanc’s in particular, he was carried to the
yacht, relieved of his clothes, and treated
to a cold bath, his usual medicine under like
circumstances. After the bath he put on a
kimona and airs and bawled for his secretary.
That individual was yanked out of
bed by the ears and Bennett dictated to him
a proclamation in the style of a South American
general starting a revolution.</p>

<p>“‘Monsieur Blanc and his associates,’ demanded
the proclamation, ‘must send three
of the directors to Mr. Bennett’s yacht,
making abject apology for the insults heaped
upon Mr. Bennett. And unless this apology
is forthcoming without evasion or delay, the
Commodore will be pleased to blow the Casino
into smithereens—he has the guns, powder
and shot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>“At nine o’clock in the morning the directors
were handed this ultimatum and they
had to act by eleven or prepare to meet their
maker, roulettes and all.</p>

<p>“Naturally the directors thought it a
drunken joke, but at eleven sharp, Bennett
began bombarding the Casino—with blank
cartridges. Hence at eleven-ten, five directors
instead of three raced to the Harbor in
carriages, and tumbled head over heels into
a white-flagged steam-pinnace.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Field, “Bennett kept them
maneuvering around his yacht for a good
fifteen minutes, while clearing decks and with
much ostentation making ready for bombardment.
When he finally <i>did</i> admit the directors,
he exacted even harder terms than he
had first proposed, namely: A perpetual card
of admission for James Gordon Bennett and
friends and, for the present, a solemn invitation
to Bennett to come to the Casino and
do as he liked there.</p>

<p>“After this,” concluded Eugene, “I suppose
these directors lent him their best grand
piano for the uses he put Phil May’s mother’s
piano to.”</p>

<p>The above was a good story, but unprintable
at the time, and it was all Eugene ever
got out of Bennett. So most other London
enterprises, Gene tried to float, proved barren.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENE_A_SUCCESS_OF_CURIOSITY">GENE, A “SUCCESS OF CURIOSITY”</h2>
</div>


<p>The fact was, poor Eugene was no business
man and, unlike Mrs. Clemens, pretty Mrs.
Field, as far as I could make out, had no eye
or head for business either. His London
writings hardly ever appealed to a more
international audience than Chicago and the
West, willy-nilly, furnished. Syndicating was
in its infancy and the papers printed nothing
but news and again news. Even the New
York Herald’s Sunday edition contained
hardly a line unconnected with the news of
the day. And Eugene said himself he was
no newsmonger. Then London society, or
near-society, tried to make him out a funny
man. He was much in demand as a diner-out,
and like an honest man, paid for his dinners
and suppers in “his own coin,” stories and
jokes.</p>

<p>These stories were all extravaganzas of
the most extravagant kind. “I talked to
the duchesses as I talk to my children when
in pinafores,” he used to tell me, “and the
harder I lie, the more natural my American
yarns sound to them, for their ignorance of
America is as profound as mine of Mars.”</p>

<p>Poor Gene, I am afraid, often accepted
dinner invitations “to save grubbing at
home,” for his finances were on the downgrade
most of the time. In his talks with
American friends he often regretted having
left Chicago, “where one can always make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
touch, if not at the office, then in the Clark
Street Emporium” (meaning Mike McDonald’s
saloon). And all the time his health
severely suffered from the damp and wet,
the sleet and raw winds, the river fogs and
the smoke fogs.</p>

<p>“I thought if I got away from coffee and
Chicago pies, my stomach would act decently
again,” he moaned sometimes; “but the
eternal tea of Britain is as bad as our coffee,
and its meat pies are even more alluring and
digestion-disturbing. I will never get well
until I can pay a cook a hundred dollars a
week and a doctor fifty to tell me what to
avoid.”</p>

<p>There was a tendency in London then,
among literary people and others, to treat
American men of letters not with scant
courtesy exactly, but as successes of curiosity.
Eugene felt that after a while and it made
him sore on London and made him long still
more for the fleshpots of Chicago. Of
course he returned a broader-minded and a
better informed man, but consider the cost
to him! The English climate, so healthful
to Londoners as to make the town’s death
rate the lowest in Europe, wrecked what
was left of Eugene’s frail health. But for
London he might have lived ten or more
years longer. Yet he never could forgive
Bennett for turning him down, though I
often explained to him that his application
may have never reached Bennett’s own desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>In a measure, too, Eugene Field was responsible
for many of his discomforts in
London, for he allowed a friend to select
most dismal quarters for him and stuck to
them instead of getting out and moving to
one of the suburbs. “Richmond would be
the place for you,” we often told him.</p>

<p>“I am the Duke of Bedford’s tenant,”
he joked, “and his Grace is pleased to have
my name on his rent roll, so what can I do?”
And then he would go into the Bedford
family history and count up its fortunes, its
land, and estates, in London and out. “Ah,”
he would say, “it stands to reason that
among Bedford’s ancestors were no penny-a-liners
or blue stockings.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DIRE_CONSEQUENCES_OF_AMERICAN">DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF AMERICAN
HORSEPLAY</h2>
</div>


<p>At the time when Eugene Field was in
London, Oscar Wilde and Henry Irving were
undoubtedly leaders of the intellectual circles,
and with both of these men Gene had
quarreled. No open rupture, but he had
played practical jokes on them—during their
American tours—something an Englishman
never forgives. And if he wanted to, his
friends and compatriots wouldn’t let him.</p>

<p>It may be true or not that Henry Irving
laughed at Gene’s caricatures of himself,
done before his very eyes, as well as behind
his back in Chicago, but that doesn’t argue
that Irving did not resent Gene’s merrymaking.
Irving had many eccentricities in
person and speech, but still more dignity.
And the dignity of his profession was very
dear to his heart. Hence there was no companionship
between the Chicago writer and
the great English actor-manager while Gene
was trying to establish himself in London.
If he had come to London under an engagement
as critic or editorial writer, it would
have been different, but Gene was only a
struggling literary man like so many others.
So the Henry Irving literary circles were
closed against the Chicago newspaper man as
a matter of course.</p>

<p>But that didn’t sour Gene’s judgment of
Irving’s art. I remember a Macbeth night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
at the Lyceum Theatre. As a production,
Irving’s Macbeth was the last word in stage
effects. I reminded Gene of the sensation
caused in Chicago by the red velvet draw
curtain which Irving had brought from London.
Up to that time Chicago had only
known paper or canvas curtains, variously
painted.</p>

<p>“Look at the scenery,” Gene kept on saying
at the Lyceum. “It’s all solid, vast,
monumental. Chicago would go crazy about
that set piece.”</p>

<p>In the lobby we met several critics, among
them the critic of the Standard. The Standard
man repeated his published charge, namely,
that Irving was sinning against tradition,
that Macready and Kemble alone had understood
how to present Macbeth. Irving, this
critic insisted, ought to know “that his
Macbeth was unacceptable to the best judgment.”</p>

<p>“Best judgment—fiddlesticks! You merely
state your personal opinion. We all do so.
For my part I like Irving’s reading with its
poetry and romanticism,” said Field hotly.
“The King of Scots was full of irresolution,
but was often dejected in spirits—Irving’s
portrait of a shrinking, faltering King is
what it ought to be, since it holds the mirror
up to history. As to tradition—that be
damned—it is largely in the critic’s mind
and nowhere else, except perhaps with some
dotard, gabbing about old times.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>That was Gene all over. If the cause was
just he would as lief fight the battles of a
man like Irving, who ignored him, as of his
best friend.</p>

<p>Here is another illustration of that golden
rule—by contrary.</p>

<p>He liked Ellen Terry, liked her immensely,
but he did not fail to criticise her severely.
You may remember Macbeth’s line:</p>

<p>“What if we fail?”</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth answers:</p>

<p>“We fail—”</p>

<p>Now Terry pronounced these two words
as if she meant to indicate—well if we fail
there’s an end to it.</p>

<p>“All wrong,” said Gene. “She ought to
pronounce it:</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> fail!”</p>

<p>“It ought to sound like: ‘Failure is a
thing not to be thought of.’”</p>

<p>“I will tell Terry about it when I see her,”
he said. Whether he carried out that intention
or not I don’t know. He always spoke
about Ellen Terry as the wonderful woman
on the stage. “Think what she makes her
body do, how she makes it respond to the
demands of every role. Her eyes are pale,
her nose is too long, her mouth is only ordinary,
yet she makes these faulty features tell
on the stage, and the audience never knows
how deficient she is as to mouth, eyes and
nose. And her complexion isn’t good—naturally
that doesn’t matter so much. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
hair is an indecent tow color. And how she
makes that lean and bony figure of hers cut
ice is wonderful. I forgot about her feet.
But her hands are too large for a woman.
Indeed they are masculine, yet her audience
is never allowed to see that. She gets you,
and she entrances you by her innate grace—such
grace as graces the world only once in
a hundred years.”</p>

<p>His troubles in America with Oscar Wilde
closed another set of literary salons in Eugene’s
face while in London. For it must
be remembered that Oscar’s disgrace took
place years later, in 1895, and that until
his quarrel with Lord Queensbury, he was a
figure to be reckoned with in London society.
He was at least as important in certain
social circles as Lillie Langtry, and was a
Mason-brother of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>“What a fool I was, estranging Oscar,”
Gene confessed. “At the time I thought it
exquisitely funny, but the British can’t see
through our American horseplay. They
think it undignified and that’s enough to kill
even the loudest laugh.”</p>

<p>“What did you do to Oscar?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The day before his arrival in Denver,
where I was doing the Tribune Primer, I
impersonated Oscar in the mask of Bunthorne
of Patience, driving through Denver
in an elegant landau and pair, and creating
a riot of mirth. Oscar thought it a good
advertisement for his lecture, and as a matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
of fact it was, but as to the humor of the
thing, he hadn’t the slightest notion, and
treated me, who had made hundreds for him,
with studied coldness.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” continued Gene, “for all I know
he may be living on the proceeds of my joke
even now, for they say he earns next to
nothing and depends on the money he saved
in the United States, from the proceeds of
his tour. But give the devil his due, Oscar
does the Prince-chap business in great style.
His game is to impress ordinary folks, the
grocer and the glovemaker, that a litterateur
is not necessarily a Bohemian living in a
garret, sporting frayed collars, having no
money for cigarettes in the morning and no
dinner money in the evening. And to demonstrate,
he dines at the swellest hotels and
restaurants and tries to cut a big swath
everywhere.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, Gene told a few
things about Oscar that he had heard at the
Herald office. “Our fine American girl,
Mary Anderson, has given that fop Oscar
a commission, duly signed, to write a drama
for her. It’s going to be called ‘The Duchess
of Padua.’ Oscar may make five or ten
thousand dollars out of it. If I wasn’t by
nature so much inclined to humor, I might
get an honorable commission like that. But
people think I am only fit for cracking jokes
and writing jocular and sentimental poetry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “Gene, everybody to his
groove. While Oscar does the highfalutin’,
you make people laugh. If you really want
to make money you ought to go on the stage.
There your gift of mimicry and imitation
ought to get you big returns, for you could
hold your own with Goodwin and Henry
Dixey.”</p>

<p>“I have been told that before,” said Gene;
“they drummed it into my head in Denver
and in Chicago, but somehow or other I
prefer the writing game to any other, even
if it keeps one on a level with proletarians.”</p>

<p>Though not mixing with Oscar Wilde’s
crowd, Gene heard a lot of gossip concerning
the author of “Salome,” and “Lady Windermere’s
Fan.” Likewise some stories about
Lady Wilde, Oscar’s mother, a most eccentric
woman, whose motto was said to be:
“Only shopkeepers are respectable.”</p>

<p>“Why, in his own mother’s house, Oscar
started a ‘Society for the Suppression of
Virtue,’” vowed Gene.</p>

<p>Then there was the famous yarn about
original sin that we heard right off the griddle.
It ran this way:</p>

<p>Said a Famous Beauty, friend of the Prince
of Wales, to Wilde:</p>

<p>“Is it not a fact that original sin began
with Adam and came down direct to you,
Oscar?”</p>

<p>Oscar, shielding his mouth with his hand,
for he had bad teeth, responded:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“No, my dear, sin commenced with Eve,
Cleopatra carried it on and with our dear
Lillie the future of sin may be safely left,
being in expert hands.”</p>

<p>While in Germany, Gene had read up on
ideas of humor, and entertained the notion
that a “History of Humor” would prove a
good seller. The book was to start with
“The Smile,” such chapters to follow as:
“Feeling Good;” “Pleasant Thoughts;”
“Why We Laugh Over the Ridiculous;”
“Whims;” “Practical Jokes;” “Fixed Ideas;”
“<i>Naiveté</i>;” “Blue-stockings;” “Old Maids,”

<p>When Gene Field returned from Hanover,
where he had placed his children in school,
he was full of the German professors he had
met.</p>

<p>I reminded him that Lord Palmerston had
called Germany “that damned land of Professors.”</p>

<p>“I know the woods are full of them. I
have seen them in droves, good, bad and
indifferent, but I put my kids with the
human kind of professor, and, besides, those
youngsters can take care of themselves. I
am told of a private tutor who, on applying
for a job at a country house, thought his
future paymaster as big a brute as himself.
Accordingly, while the rich man was drawing
up a contract, this tutor fell upon the boys,
his future charges, as he thought, and began
to thrash them without any cause whatever
in the most cruel and barbarous fashion.</p>

<p>“The children’s howls brought the father
to the scene, who seized the scoundrel by
the neck and demanded what he meant by
assaulting his boys.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ answered the tutor, ‘I meant to
show them right away that I am master.’</p>

<p>“‘And I will show you who is master
here,’ shouted the father, and gave that
tutor the licking of his life. Then he kicked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
him out of doors, and said: ‘Now run, for
in five minutes I will loose my dogs, and if
they catch you, God have mercy upon your
soul.’”</p>

LORE</h2>

<p>While in London Eugene Field was always
talking about the Orkney Islands, the dreariest,
foggiest, most uninteresting patches of
land in the wet you want to see. He had
discovered somehow that Queen Mary of
Scots had created that brute Bothwell, duke
of Orkney, a title reserved for members of
the reigning family. Hence her bestowal of
the title helped to emphasize still more the
hatred of the nobles against her husband.
He chewed the matter over for a month,
then one rainy afternoon, at the Cafe Royal,
he got it off his chest.</p>

<p>“I want to go to the Orkney Islands to
find traces of Bothwell and perhaps get a new
angle on that fearless lass—as fearless as she
was vindictive—Mary. When the Queen was
taken prisoner, Bothwell made for the Orkneys
and chose one of the smaller islands to
assemble a piratical navy. Instead of stealing
queens, he meant to steal goods and
chattels of merchantmen passing the Northern
Seas and the Channel. He had been a pirate
before Mary took him up and was a robber
baron by birth. Wonder if his remains rest
in the Orkneys or at the bottom of the sea.”</p>

<p>“He was buried in some small Danish
seaboard town and in a church at that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he died in the odor of sanctity,”
laughed Gene; “that would make it only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
more interesting. Anyhow from the Orkneys
I can easily get to Denmark and from there
I can almost swim over to Sweden. I want
to dig deep into Northern lore—there are
unexplored tons of it, full of the most sublime
poetry, and when I return to America and
have time to look over my notes, there
will be something doing, I promise you, my
boy.”</p>

<p>Returning to Bothwell, Field asked:</p>

<p>“By the way, I read somewhere that Mary
was divorced from Bothwell while in English
captivity.”</p>

<p>“If you can get hold of the Vatican records
about that divorce,” I answered, “the fortune
of your book amongst scholars is made. What
do you suppose was the cause of the divorce
granted by the Roman Court?”</p>

<p>“Why, the murder of Mary’s second husband,
the Earl of Darnley, at which she and
Bothwell had connived.”</p>

<p>“Wrong.”</p>

<p>“Or the fact that Bothwell was a Protestant,
a heretic.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again.”</p>

<p>“Then because Bothwell was still the husband
of Ann Thorssen when he married the
Queen.”</p>

<p>“Wrong the third time. The divorce was
granted on evidence that Bothwell had intercourse
with Mary before marriage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>One of these Northern lore stories Field
wrote for a little book of Christmas tales,
but having been unable to carry out his
intention as above set forth, the yarn was of
small account. It lacked local color and the
naturalness that made most of his stories
so delightful.</p>

<p>It has been forgotten by this time that
Gene lost a son while the boy was at school
in Hanover—the most promising of his boys,
it was said. But at the time when the grieving
father brought the body of his boy home,
a great many lovers of his poetry associated
the child’s death with the famous “Little
Boy Blue.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, “Little Boy
Blue” was not the echo of a fond parent’s
sorrow, but was written when all his children
were flourishing. At the time Gene was
simply in a sentimental mood. Maybe, too,
some newspaper story he read was responsible.
At any rate, “Little Boy Blue” was
published and admired and beloved a year
or two, or longer, before Gene went to Europe,
and while all his children enjoyed good
health.</p>
